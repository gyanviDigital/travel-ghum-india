</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Paying for Things in India</h4>



<p>While credit and debit cards are widely accepted in cities, cash is still king in many rural areas and small towns. ATMs are plentiful, but it&#8217;s a good idea to carry some cash, especially for small purchases and transportation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Scams in India</h3>



<p>India is generally safe for tourists, but like any other destination, it&#8217;s essential to be aware of common scams:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Child Beggars and Other Vagrants</h4>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of Pondicherry</h2>



<p>Pondicherry, often referred to as &#8220;Puducherry&#8221; or simply &#8220;Pondy,&#8221; boasts a rich history that dates back to ancient times. The town has been influenced by various cultures over the centuries, from the Romans and Greeks to the Cholas and Vijayanagara Empire. However, the most significant period in Pondicherry&#8217;s history began with the arrival of the French in the late 17th century.</p>



<p>In 1674, the French East India Company established a trading post in Pondicherry, which eventually grew into a thriving colonial settlement. The French influence is still evident today in the town&#8217;s architecture, cuisine, and overall ambiance. Walking through the streets of the French Quarter, also known as White Town, feels like stepping back in time to a French colonial era. The grid-patterned streets, colonial buildings, and vibrant bougainvillea-covered walls add to the town&#8217;s charm.</p>



<p>Pondicherry remained under French control until 1954, when it was formally transferred to the Republic of India. Despite this change, the town has retained its unique blend of French and Indian cultures, making it a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ropeway</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-1024x574.jpg" alt="Ropeway in manali," class="wp-image-2663" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

One should only go river rafting in a helmet or life jacket to avoid accidents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Hot air Balloon ride</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali.jpg" alt="Hot air Balloon ride manali,Best Manali Adventure Sports," class="wp-image-2668" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Manali is also a trekker&#8217;s heaven. One may choose a companion or trek along, keeping the Himalayas and Pine Trees at bay between the forests for an incredible sight amongst the mountains.

Trekking lets you enjoy the essence of sunset and sunrise, closely peeping through the mountains.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Reach Manali</h3>



<p><strong>Ghum India Ghum</strong>, a leading <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tour and travel company in Delhi</a></strong> will arrange these packages along with other destinations of your choice. There are multiple ways to reach the peaceful hill station in Himachal. The modes of transport to reach Manali are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By road</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bus services are available from Shimla, Leh, and Chandigarh. It is a budget-friendly option. Also, enjoying the picturesque scenery by road can be the most suitable choice. It is better to skip this option, as it might take longer hours to reach if someone travels by road with kids or senior citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Train</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The nearest railway station to this hill station is Joginder Nagar. A specific train called Kalka Mail is a viable pick. Travelling through the tunnels on Kalka Mail is scary and a remarkable experience.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Air</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Direct flights are available from Delhi and Chandigarh up to Manali, and the nearest airport is Bhuntar. This is by far the most expensive choice. Moreover, it is the fastest means of transport to reach the desired destination.</p>



<p>The white abode of magnificent peaks coupled with green valleys, rivers, waterfalls, wildlife tours, whether on a solo trip or with family and ever-so-pleasant weather, is everything you get in a trip to <strong>Best Manali Adventure Sports</strong>.
