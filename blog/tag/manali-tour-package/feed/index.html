										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Manali, nestled in the district of Kullu, is not just a popular tourist attraction but also a gateway to the majestic Himalayas.  The best time to visit Manali Adventure Sports is from March to June when you can escape the scorching heat and bask in the beauty of the snow-capped mountains. However, if you prefer a winter wonderland, the ideal time to visit is from October to February. Manali is home to several tourist spots, including the serene Manikaran Gurudwara, the picturesque Bhrigu Lake, the adventurous Solang Nullah, the tranquil Prashar Lake, and the majestic Beas River, to name a few.  </p>



<p>Planning a vacation to Manali won&#8217;t break the bank. It&#8217;s a budget-friendly destination with an average cost of 12,000- 15,000 per person for a two-day, three-night stay. And the best part? It&#8217;s not just about the stunning viewpoints. Manali offers many fun activities and amusements, ensuring a memorable trip for all.</p>



<p>Thus, a few of the adventure sports at Manali are discussed in detail below-</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Ropeway</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-1024x574.jpg" alt="Ropeway in manali," class="wp-image-2663" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ropeway-in-manali.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>River Rafting at Manali, often shown at cinemas, is equally gripping and an adrenal rushing experience with gushing winds around, and the flowing river is an ever-so-amazing activity to perform throughout the year. Furthermore, river rafting is mainly done by 2–6 people at maximum.

One should only go river rafting in a helmet or life jacket to avoid accidents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Hot air Balloon ride</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali.jpg" alt="Hot air Balloon ride manali,Best Manali Adventure Sports," class="wp-image-2668" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Manali is also a trekker&#8217;s heaven. One may choose a companion or trek along, keeping the Himalayas and Pine Trees at bay between the forests for an incredible sight amongst the mountains. At the same time, one should grab proper food and warm clothes as per convenience while trekking. Anyone with asthma or other breathing-related issues shall refrain from performing this activity. Trekking lets you enjoy the essence of sunset and sunrise, closely peeping through the mountains.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Reach Manali</h3>



<p><strong>Ghum India Ghum</strong>, a leading <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tour and travel company in Delhi</a></strong> will arrange these packages along with other destinations of your choice. There are multiple ways to reach the peaceful hill station in Himachal. The modes of transport to reach Manali are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By road</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bus services are available from Shimla, Leh, and Chandigarh. It is a budget-friendly option. Also, enjoying the picturesque scenery by road can be the most suitable choice. It is better to skip this option, as it might take longer hours to reach if someone travels by road with kids or senior citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Train</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The nearest railway station to this hill station is Joginder Nagar. A specific train called Kalka Mail is a viable pick. Travelling through the tunnels on Kalka Mail is scary and a remarkable experience.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Air</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Direct flights are available from Delhi and Chandigarh up to Manali, and the nearest airport is Bhuntar. This is by far the most expensive choice. Moreover, it is the fastest means of transport to reach the desired destination.</p>



<p>The white abode of magnificent peaks coupled with green valleys, rivers, waterfalls, wildlife tours, whether on a solo trip or with family and ever-so-pleasant weather, is everything you get in a trip to <strong>Best Manali Adventure Sports</strong>. Finally, also known as the &#8220;Land of God,&#8221; Manali is widely famous for its rich flora and fauna. Likewise, its mesmerising glory is a sight to behold for a lifetime.

<p>Do you know that Dharamshala is known as the winter capital of Kangra district? God blesses us with a pleasant climate during summer as well.

It won&#8217;t get frosty; you can expect little rainfall and hailstorms from May onwards.</p>



<p>But if you plan to visit during the monsoon season, it is not a good idea, from July to September, as there is a high risk of landslides.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bhyagsunag Waterfalls</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="606" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls.jpeg" alt="Bhyagsunag Waterfalls, Dharamshala tour package," class="wp-image-2554" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls.jpeg 1000w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-300x182.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-768x465.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-150x91.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Are you among the people who love the sound of water? Then it would be best if you went to Bhyagsunag Waterfalls, situated in the quaint little village of Bhagsu. These falls are one of the most well-known and visited tourist attractions in the Dharamshala district.</p>



<p>A trekking trail takes you up to the point from where the waterfalls are. The path of the trek might be slippery; hence, the elders and children should avoid it.</p>

<p>Embrace the beauty of nature. Dharamshala&#8217;s scenic beauty will leave you spellbound. It will soothe both your eyes and soul. Its charm will remain in you for a longer time. Dharamshala&#8217;s beauty is something that no one can resist visiting at regular intervals.</p>
