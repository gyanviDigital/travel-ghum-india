<p><strong>Chulgiri jain temple</strong> is surrounded by the Aravalli range, which gives you a beautiful and captivating view from the top of the hill. It is a proper blend of adventure, beautiful nature, and religiosity. Chulgiri Trek Hill is one of the most attractive places in Jaipur. Jains particularly regard Chulgiri as one of the holiest and most well-known locations in the world because a stunning white-marbled Jain temple sits perched atop the hill. Its most attractive thing is its calm nature, which gives you a soothing feeling.</p>

<p>In 1953, Acharya Shri Desh Bhushan Ji founded the Chulgiri Jain temple. When he reached this place, seeking peace to engage in serious meditation, and because of the area&#8217;s peace and quiet, he ultimately chose to conduct soul-searching. Following that, he constructed the &#8220;Chulgiri&#8221; Jain temple.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">About Chulgiri Hills</h3>



<p>Nestled in the Aravalli hills, next to the Ghat Ki Guni tunnel, lies the temple dedicated to Chulgiri. This is the peak of the Chulgiri trek Mountains. There are a thousand steps leading up to the temple. In 1966, sculptors created three white stone statues representing Shree Parshavnath, the Tirthankars, and Neminath. During renovations, installers added 24 additional Tirthankars and a water tank to collect prayer water. Then, in 1982, builders erected a 65-foot dome and one of Mahaveer Swami&#8217;s tallest statues, standing around 21 feet tall and carved from a single piece of white stone. Craftsmen use white marble to create this stunning temple, which features exquisite and unique decorations.</p>



<p>Chulgiri temple has diverse flora and fauna, as well as many plants, animals, and birds. Indrajeet and Kumbhakaran are believed to have prayed and meditated here in ancient times. It is a unique and historic palace if you follow Jainism. This temple is one of the famous sightseeing places in Jaipur, providing you with a magnificent view from the top. The Aravali ranges encircling the temple make it more beautiful. The Jain Chulgiri temple is a digambara shrine. Walking up to the temple is quite thrilling.</p>



<p>This temple is a special place for Jains in the Chulgiri trek hills near Jaipur&#8217;s outskirts. Chulgiri temple reflects the rich culture of Jainism in Rajasthan. The art and designs of this temple are so mesmerising and unique. After reaching the top of the Chulgiri hills, you can enjoy the serene beauty and calm from a panoramic view. You can also take a peaceful walk down through the lush greenery around the Chulgiri temple.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Best Time to Visit</h3>



<p>The Chulgiri Jain Temple is open to tourists year-round. You can therefore visit this temple throughout the year. Every season has its own unique beauty!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Best Season</strong>: Winter is the best time to visit Chulgiri Jain temple, particularly from October to March. In winter, the weather remains calm and pleasant, and the steps to the temple&#8217;s premises are easy to climb. It feels less exhausting in winter than in summer.</li>

</ul>



<p>However, monsoon season is also an excellent time to visit Chulgiri Hill. You will be mesmerised to see the beauty of nature during this time.
