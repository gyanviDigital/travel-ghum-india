<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Scams in India</h3>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Child Beggars and Other Vagrants</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Chulgiri jain temple</strong> is surrounded by the Aravalli range, which gives you a beautiful and captivating view from the top of the hill. It is a proper blend of adventure, beautiful nature, and religiosity. Chulgiri Trek Hill is one of the most attractive places in Jaipur. Jains particularly regard Chulgiri as one of the holiest and most well-known locations in the world because a stunning white-marbled Jain temple sits perched atop the hill. Its most attractive thing is its calm nature, which gives you a soothing feeling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chulgiri Jain Temple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="694" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2.jpg" alt="Chulgiri Jain Temple in jaipur" class="wp-image-2587" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2.jpg 694w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2-150x104.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure>



<p>In 1953, Acharya Shri Desh Bhushan Ji founded the Chulgiri Jain temple. When he reached this place, seeking peace to engage in serious meditation, and because of the area&#8217;s peace and quiet, he ultimately chose to conduct soul-searching. Following that, he constructed the &#8220;Chulgiri&#8221; Jain temple.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">About Chulgiri Hills</h3>



<p>Nestled in the Aravalli hills, next to the Ghat Ki Guni tunnel, lies the temple dedicated to Chulgiri. This is the peak of the Chulgiri trek Mountains. There are a thousand steps leading up to the temple. In 1966, sculptors created three white stone statues representing Shree Parshavnath, the Tirthankars, and Neminath. During renovations, installers added 24 additional Tirthankars and a water tank to collect prayer water. Then, in 1982, builders erected a 65-foot dome and one of Mahaveer Swami&#8217;s tallest statues, standing around 21 feet tall and carved from a single piece of white stone. Craftsmen use white marble to create this stunning temple, which features exquisite and unique decorations.</p>



<p>Chulgiri temple has diverse flora and fauna, as well as many plants, animals, and birds. Indrajeet and Kumbhakaran are believed to have prayed and meditated here in ancient times. It is a unique and historic palace if you follow Jainism. This temple is one of the famous sightseeing places in Jaipur, providing you with a magnificent view from the top. The Aravali ranges encircling the temple make it more beautiful. The Jain Chulgiri temple is a digambara shrine. Walking up to the temple is quite thrilling.</p>



<p>This temple is a special place for Jains in the Chulgiri trek hills near Jaipur&#8217;s outskirts. Chulgiri temple reflects the rich culture of Jainism in Rajasthan. The art and designs of this temple are so mesmerising and unique. After reaching the top of the Chulgiri hills, you can enjoy the serene beauty and calm from a panoramic view. You can also take a peaceful walk down through the lush greenery around the Chulgiri temple.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Best Time to Visit</h3>



<p>The Chulgiri Jain Temple is open to tourists year-round. You can therefore visit this temple throughout the year. Every season has its own unique beauty!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Best Season</strong>: Winter is the best time to visit Chulgiri Jain temple, particularly from October to March. In winter, the weather remains calm and pleasant, and the steps to the temple&#8217;s premises are easy to climb. It feels less exhausting in winter than in summer.</li>



<li><strong>Best Day of The Week</strong>: You should visit the Chulgiri Jain temple on weekdays. As weekends have the highest number of devotees. On weekdays, you can avoid standing in long queues at the temple and enjoy exploring the temple at your own pace.</li>

</ul>



<p>However, monsoon season is also an excellent time to visit Chulgiri Hill. You will be mesmerised to see the beauty of nature during this time.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Exploring a same day trip from Delhi is not just a journey via roads but also an unforgettable memory lifetime. When the topic is about <strong>best same day trips from Delhi</strong>,<strong> <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghum India Ghum</a></strong> is the leading travel agency. One-day trips are a boon for many who want a refreshing start at the beginning of the week.</p>



<p>This extensive guide will assist you through every step of your day trips from Delhi. You can easily explore fun one-day destinations with friends and family near Delhi, rather than high budgets, disrupting your daily routines.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the most popular one-day trips from Delhi:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Jaipur</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="jaipur day trip tour package" class="wp-image-2452" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In just a 5-hour ride you can visit the marvellous ‘Pink City’ if you can plan your day to see the most popular ones. Starting from the magnificent Amber Fort, followed by the majestic Hawa Mahal and the unique amalgamation of ancient architecture of temples will make your journey unforgettable. The elegant sight of Lake Palace with coloured stones and deep blue water will undoubtedly make you another admirer.</p>



<p>This <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/day-trips-from-jaipur">Jaipur day trip from Delhi</a></strong> will mesmerise your inner soul and certainly lighten up your boring weekend.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach</strong></h4>



<p>Delhi has three different routes to Jaipur. These routes are via NE4, NH21 and NH48. You can get it via NE4 and NH21 in just 5 hours and 10 mins, but NH48 would be the fastest way, as it is only 276 km away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Bharatpur</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="990" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-1024x990.jpeg" alt="Bharatpur day trips from Delhi" class="wp-image-2453" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-1024x990.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-300x290.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-768x742.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi.jpeg 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The second one on the list is an off-beat destination, heaven for bird lovers. While planning for <strong>Bharatpur day trips from Delhi</strong>, you must add Lohagarh Fort, Laxman Mandir, Chawad Devi temple, and Ganga Mandir. The Keoladeo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to hundreds of bird species. Your trip to Bharatpur will be incomplete if you don’t visit this bird sanctuary.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach:</strong></h4>



<p>You can take the Yamuna Expressway or NH44 to travel from Delhi to Bharatpur. It will take approximately 4 hours to reach Bharatpur via Yamuna Expressway. The 215 km route of NH44 will take you to your destination in just 4 hours and 17 mins.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Agra</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpeg" alt="Agra day trip from Delhi" class="wp-image-2454" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Agra, known for &#8216;The Taj Mahal,&#8217; symbolises love and is famous for its stunning scenic beauty. The architectural masterpiece is Agra&#8217;s top tourist attraction, but the city has many other popular destinations.</p>



<p>You can explore the ancient Red Fort alongside the Yamuna River and Akbar&#8217;s tomb, constructed from red sandstone. The Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in India, and Guru-ka-Tal Gurudwara are the major tourist attractions here. Thus, end your <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/agra-tour-packages">Agra day trip from Delhi</a> </strong>with the charming sunset from the Taj Mahal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach:</strong> </h4>



<p>Two routes are available to reach Agra from Delhi. You can get the distance of 243 km via Yamuna Expressway in just 3 hours and 44 mins. Otherwise, you can take NH 44, which will take you to just four houses and 12 minutes to the city of love.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Sariska National Park</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="890" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-1024x890.jpeg" alt="Sariska National Park" class="wp-image-2455" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-1024x890.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-300x261.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-768x668.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park.jpeg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Sariska National Park is your go-to place if you are an animal lover like us. Surrounded by Aravalli hills, Rajasthan’s most famous tiger reserve is the must-visit place for your one-day trip to Sariska National Park from Delhi.</p>



<p>Start your trip by exploring the wildlife and its green beauty with a jeep safari. You can’t miss the sight of ‘The Royal Bengal Tiger” on your journey to Sariska. During your visit, you can also see many animals, such as the Leopard, Sambhar, Nilgai, Four Horned Antelope, Langur, and Wild Boar.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach:</strong> </h4>



<p>NH 4 was the fastest route to Sariska National Park. However, due to heavy traffic, you can go through the Alwar bypass to cover the distance of 191 km in 4 hours and 29 minutes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Mathura and Vrindavan</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpg" alt="Mathura and Vrindavan day trip from Delhi" class="wp-image-2457" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The divine city of Lord Krishna and its religious heritage always draw attention from Krishna’s devotees. The spiritual divineness flows in the breeze of Mathura, where you can still feel the presence of the Lord. The sound of his flute still flows around Shree Krishna Janmabhoomi and Dwarkadheesh temple, Govardhan hills, and Radha Kund e between the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>



<p>These would be your best destination for <strong>Mathura and Vrindavan day trip from Delhi </strong>by road. Stunning wall paintings and heritage architecture of Prem mandir are a must-visit for you if you are a true devotee of the ‘God of Love’ or a mythological enthusiast like us.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach: </strong></h4>



<p>There are two routes to go on a <strong>Mathura and Vrindavan day trip from Delhi.</strong> You can cover the short distance of 182 km via the best and fastest Yamuna Expressway. Or else, you can take the NH 44 to cover the distance of 170 km in 3 hr 17 min.</p>
