<p>Manali is also a trekker&#8217;s heaven. One may choose a companion or trek along, keeping the Himalayas and Pine Trees at bay between the forests for an incredible sight amongst the mountains. At the same time, one should grab proper food and warm clothes as per convenience while trekking. Anyone with asthma or other breathing-related issues shall refrain from performing this activity. Trekking lets you enjoy the essence of sunset and sunrise, closely peeping through the mountains.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Reach Manali</h3>



<p><strong>Ghum India Ghum</strong>, a leading <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tour and travel company in Delhi</a></strong> will arrange these packages along with other destinations of your choice. There are multiple ways to reach the peaceful hill station in Himachal. The modes of transport to reach Manali are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By road</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bus services are available from Shimla, Leh, and Chandigarh. It is a budget-friendly option. Also, enjoying the picturesque scenery by road can be the most suitable choice. It is better to skip this option, as it might take longer hours to reach if someone travels by road with kids or senior citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Train</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The nearest railway station to this hill station is Joginder Nagar. A specific train called Kalka Mail is a viable pick. Travelling through the tunnels on Kalka Mail is scary and a remarkable experience.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Air</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Direct flights are available from Delhi and Chandigarh up to Manali, and the nearest airport is Bhuntar. This is by far the most expensive choice. Moreover, it is the fastest means of transport to reach the desired destination.</p>



<p>The white abode of magnificent peaks coupled with green valleys, rivers, waterfalls, wildlife tours, whether on a solo trip or with family and ever-so-pleasant weather, is everything you get in a trip to <strong>Best Manali Adventure Sports</strong>.

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga-meditation-rishikesh.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-580" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga-meditation-rishikesh.jpg 640w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga-meditation-rishikesh-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>The union of the existence with the non existence is yoga. It is a practice which expands beyond the physical aerobics and furthers itself beyond spirituality. That which remains is yoga. Yoga is Truth.</p>



<p>Note:- <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-film-theme-based-tour-package/"><strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel film Theme Based Tour Package</strong></a></p>



<p>India (Bharat) is the birth place of this holy practice of yoga.
However, truth cannot have a beginning or an end. This is because truth is
absolute. If a statement is relative, then it is not the truth, as it is
subject to change with the movement of time. Hence, yoga has forever existed
and will forever exist. For the clarity of understanding as far as the human
intellect can fathom, its propagation began in the holy subcontinent of India (Bharat).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-1024x640.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-581" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24.jpg 1680w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ancient Rishis (sages) propagated this enlightening knowledge to those
who were fit to practice it. Those who wanted to acquire this knowledge were
fit to practice and hence experienced the revolutionary benefits of yoga. This
is the knowledge for which millions of people from all around the world travel
to different parts of Bharat. As it is Truth, it has no religious boundaries.
For this reason, Bharat experiences a diversity in the population interested to
gain the wisdom of the Yoga and the Vedic scriptures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="912" height="650" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-582" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1.jpg 912w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1-768x547.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" /></figure>



<p>It is important that we understand the importance of India for the learning of yoga and other Bharatiya (Indian) spiritual practices. As its point of propagation and consistent practice which is integrated into the culture, the yogic wisdom remains unadulterated here. It is here that great teachers aid in the revaluation of the truth. And it is here that has the spiritual infrastructure to sustain such a spiritual growth. India have to offer lot of <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com">Yoga tour in india</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-1024x576.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-583" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For this reason, Bharat is an apt destination for the evolution of
the self in the spiritual paradigm. </p>



<p>Every year, thousands of courses are arranged so that the truth can
be spread for the benefit of the world and it has become a observable success.
Bharat invites the world to learn and elevate themselves for the benefit of the
self, for the benefit of the Nation, and for the benefit of the World. Yoga
tourism&nbsp; in India is next big thing in
Indian tourism market govt is also very serious&nbsp;
