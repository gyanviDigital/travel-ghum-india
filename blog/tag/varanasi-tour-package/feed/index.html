<p><strong>1) Dashashwamedh Ghat</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ghat_Dasaswamedh-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1580" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ghat_Dasaswamedh-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ghat_Dasaswamedh-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ghat_Dasaswamedh-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ghat_Dasaswamedh-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ghat_Dasaswamedh-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Dashashwamedh Ghat is one of the most popular ghats present in the city of Varanasi. What makes the Dashashwamedh Ghat most special is its Ganga Aarti.

The Ganga Aarti is performed beautifully, and one needs to be there to fully understand what makes the experience so special.</p>



<p><strong>2) Manikarnika Ghat</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Manikarnika_Cremation_Ghat_Varanasi-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1572" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Manikarnika_Cremation_Ghat_Varanasi-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Manikarnika_Cremation_Ghat_Varanasi-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Manikarnika_Cremation_Ghat_Varanasi-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Manikarnika_Cremation_Ghat_Varanasi.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Manikarnika Ghat is a famous ghat in Varanasi which is considered a holy cremation ground for Hindus. It is believed that Hindus who get cremated at Manikarnika Ghat are able to attain moksha, which is the Hindu concept that involves being free of the cycle of rebirth.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>3) Assi Ghat</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="577" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/assi-ghat-varanasi-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1573" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/assi-ghat-varanasi-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/assi-ghat-varanasi-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/assi-ghat-varanasi-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/assi-ghat-varanasi.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Assi Ghat is famous for its Shiva Lingam, where devotees visit to pray after bathing in the Ganges River. A Ganga Aarti is also performed at the Assi ghat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assi Ghat is one of the oldest ghats in Varanasi and is among the ghats over there that no tourist can afford to miss. For this reason,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>tour operators in Delhi</strong></a>&nbsp;include Assi ghat in their Varanasi tour packages.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4) Harishchandra Ghat</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harishchandra-Ghat-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1582" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harishchandra-Ghat-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harishchandra-Ghat-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harishchandra-Ghat-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Harishchandra-Ghat-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Harischandra Ghat in Varanasi is similar to the Manikarnika Ghat. The similarity is due to the fact that being cremated there is also considered sacred in Hinduism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Harischandra Ghat also offers a splendid view of the sunset and sunrise.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel companies in Delhi</a></strong>&nbsp;include the Harischandra Ghat in their itinerary for the Varanasi tour due to its importance.&nbsp;</p>
