										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Chulgiri jain temple</strong> is surrounded by the Aravalli range, which gives you a beautiful and captivating view from the top of the hill. It is a proper blend of adventure, beautiful nature, and religiosity. Chulgiri Trek Hill is one of the most attractive places in Jaipur. Jains particularly regard Chulgiri as one of the holiest and most well-known locations in the world because a stunning white-marbled Jain temple sits perched atop the hill. Its most attractive thing is its calm nature, which gives you a soothing feeling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chulgiri Jain Temple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="694" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2.jpg" alt="Chulgiri Jain Temple in jaipur" class="wp-image-2587" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2.jpg 694w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2-150x104.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure>



<p>In 1953, Acharya Shri Desh Bhushan Ji founded the Chulgiri Jain temple. When he reached this place, seeking peace to engage in serious meditation, and because of the area&#8217;s peace and quiet, he ultimately chose to conduct soul-searching. Following that, he constructed the &#8220;Chulgiri&#8221; Jain temple.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">About Chulgiri Hills</h3>



<p>Nestled in the Aravalli hills, next to the Ghat Ki Guni tunnel, lies the temple dedicated to Chulgiri. This is the peak of the Chulgiri trek Mountains. There are a thousand steps leading up to the temple. In 1966, sculptors created three white stone statues representing Shree Parshavnath, the Tirthankars, and Neminath. During renovations, installers added 24 additional Tirthankars and a water tank to collect prayer water.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Exploring a same day trip from Delhi is not just a journey via roads but also an unforgettable memory lifetime. When the topic is about <strong>best same day trips from Delhi</strong>,<strong> <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghum India Ghum</a></strong> is the leading travel agency. One-day trips are a boon for many who want a refreshing start at the beginning of the week.</p>



<p>This extensive guide will assist you through every step of your day trips from Delhi. You can easily explore fun one-day destinations with friends and family near Delhi, rather than high budgets, disrupting your daily routines.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the most popular one-day trips from Delhi:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Jaipur</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-1024x576.jpeg" alt="jaipur day trip tour package" class="wp-image-2452" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Jaipur-tour-package-1.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In just a 5-hour ride you can visit the marvellous ‘Pink City’ if you can plan your day to see the most popular ones. Starting from the magnificent Amber Fort, followed by the majestic Hawa Mahal and the unique amalgamation of ancient architecture of temples will make your journey unforgettable. The elegant sight of Lake Palace with coloured stones and deep blue water will undoubtedly make you another admirer.</p>



<p>This <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/day-trips-from-jaipur">Jaipur day trip from Delhi</a></strong> will mesmerise your inner soul and certainly lighten up your boring weekend.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach</strong></h4>



<p>Delhi has three different routes to Jaipur. These routes are via NE4, NH21 and NH48. You can get it via NE4 and NH21 in just 5 hours and 10 mins, but NH48 would be the fastest way, as it is only 276 km away.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Bharatpur</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="990" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-1024x990.jpeg" alt="Bharatpur day trips from Delhi" class="wp-image-2453" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-1024x990.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-300x290.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi-768x742.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bharatpur-day-trips-from-Delhi.jpeg 1158w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The second one on the list is an off-beat destination, heaven for bird lovers. While planning for <strong>Bharatpur day trips from Delhi</strong>, you must add Lohagarh Fort, Laxman Mandir, Chawad Devi temple, and Ganga Mandir. The Keoladeo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is home to hundreds of bird species. Your trip to Bharatpur will be incomplete if you don’t visit this bird sanctuary.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach:</strong></h4>



<p>You can take the Yamuna Expressway or NH44 to travel from Delhi to Bharatpur. It will take approximately 4 hours to reach Bharatpur via Yamuna Expressway. The 215 km route of NH44 will take you to your destination in just 4 hours and 17 mins.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Agra</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpeg" alt="Agra day trip from Delhi" class="wp-image-2454" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Agra-day-trip-from-Delhi-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Agra, known for &#8216;The Taj Mahal,&#8217; symbolises love and is famous for its stunning scenic beauty. The architectural masterpiece is Agra&#8217;s top tourist attraction, but the city has many other popular destinations.</p>



<p>You can explore the ancient Red Fort alongside the Yamuna River and Akbar&#8217;s tomb, constructed from red sandstone. The Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in India, and Guru-ka-Tal Gurudwara are the major tourist attractions here. Thus, end your <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/agra-tour-packages">Agra day trip from Delhi</a> </strong>with the charming sunset from the Taj Mahal.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach:</strong> </h4>



<p>Two routes are available to reach Agra from Delhi. You can get the distance of 243 km via Yamuna Expressway in just 3 hours and 44 mins. Otherwise, you can take NH 44, which will take you to just four houses and 12 minutes to the city of love.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Sariska National Park</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="890" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-1024x890.jpeg" alt="Sariska National Park" class="wp-image-2455" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-1024x890.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-300x261.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park-768x668.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sariska-National-Park.jpeg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Sariska National Park is your go-to place if you are an animal lover like us. Surrounded by Aravalli hills, Rajasthan’s most famous tiger reserve is the must-visit place for your one-day trip to Sariska National Park from Delhi.</p>



<p>Start your trip by exploring the wildlife and its green beauty with a jeep safari. You can’t miss the sight of ‘The Royal Bengal Tiger” on your journey to Sariska. During your visit, you can also see many animals, such as the Leopard, Sambhar, Nilgai, Four Horned Antelope, Langur, and Wild Boar.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach:</strong> </h4>



<p>NH 4 was the fastest route to Sariska National Park. However, due to heavy traffic, you can go through the Alwar bypass to cover the distance of 191 km in 4 hours and 29 minutes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. Mathura and Vrindavan</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpg" alt="Mathura and Vrindavan day trip from Delhi" class="wp-image-2457" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Mathura-and-Vrindavan-day-trip-from-Delhi-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The divine city of Lord Krishna and its religious heritage always draw attention from Krishna’s devotees. The spiritual divineness flows in the breeze of Mathura, where you can still feel the presence of the Lord. The sound of his flute still flows around Shree Krishna Janmabhoomi and Dwarkadheesh temple, Govardhan hills, and Radha Kund e between the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>



<p>These would be your best destination for <strong>Mathura and Vrindavan day trip from Delhi </strong>by road. Stunning wall paintings and heritage architecture of Prem mandir are a must-visit for you if you are a true devotee of the ‘God of Love’ or a mythological enthusiast like us.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach: </strong></h4>



<p>There are two routes to go on a <strong>Mathura and Vrindavan day trip from Delhi.</strong> You can cover the short distance of 182 km via the best and fastest Yamuna Expressway. Or else, you can take the NH 44 to cover the distance of 170 km in 3 hr 17 min.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">6. <strong>Haridwar Rishikesh</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="798" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Haridwar-Rishikesh-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpeg" alt="Haridwar Rishikesh day trip from Delhi" class="wp-image-2456" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Haridwar-Rishikesh-day-trip-from-Delhi.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Haridwar-Rishikesh-day-trip-from-Delhi-300x234.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Haridwar-Rishikesh-day-trip-from-Delhi-768x599.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Undoubtedly, this colourful city is another go-to destination for your one-day weekend trip. You can visit here during ‘Kumbh Mela’, where an auspicious gathering is celebrated every 12 years.</p>



<p>During your <strong>Haridwar Rishikesh day trip from Delhi, </strong>you can visit Har-ki-Pauri, Shantikunj, Rajaji National Park, and Mansa Devi Temple. These mesmerising sites will leave you spellbound with their rich architecture and heritage.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to reach: </strong></h4>



<p>You can reach Haridwar and Rishikesh to Delhi in around 4 hours and 26 minutes via NH334, or you can go via the Panipat Expressway to cover the 263 km distance in 4 hours and 36 minutes.</p>



<p>These six destinations are full of historic heritage and divine beauty. You can easily escape from your daily hustle and bustle. Each destination is unique, whether you are a spiritual being or a nature lover.</p>



<p>Moreover, its scenic beauty will mesmerise you with its timeless elegance. Witness the serene beauty, explore local foods, and have fun with your travel partners. Enjoy the enchanting sight of the glorious sun melting away in the evening sky on this one-day road trip.</p>

<p>Finding a good tour operator can make your travel experience in India much more enjoyable. Here&#8217;s how to find one that suits your needs without spending too much:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-03-at-12.31.32-PM-2-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-2418" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-03-at-12.31.32-PM-2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-03-at-12.31.32-PM-2-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-03-at-12.31.32-PM-2-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WhatsApp-Image-2024-05-03-at-12.31.32-PM-2.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ol>
<li>Ask People You Know Start by asking friends and family for tour agency recommendations. They might know a local agency they&#8217;ve used before that can create a trip tailored just for you.<br></li>



<li>Hassle-Free Transportation Options A good tour agency should offer car rentals, which are often the most convenient way to travel. If cars aren&#8217;t ideal for your destination, they should suggest better options. For example, <strong>Ghum India Ghum</strong> Tour Operators have a wide range of vehicles in key South Indian cities and various rental choices to ensure a comfortable and safe journey.<br></li>



<li>Look for Problem-Solving Skills Travel can have unexpected issues, like last-minute flight cancellations or closed destinations. Choose a <strong>tour agency in delhi</strong> with experience in solving travel problems. They should support you throughout your trip, not just plan it. A good agency will assist with flights, itineraries, hotels, visas, and travel insurance. For instance, if you&#8217;re planning a cultural tour, you might want to find agencies that offer immersive experiences in local traditions, festivals, and historical sites.<br></li>



<li>Look Online Check out tour agencies near you on the internet. Their websites, social media, and online forums can tell you a lot. Look for customer reviews to see if others had a good experience with them. If you have a specific place in mind, look for agencies that offer specialized trips to that location. For example, if wildlife interests you,&nbsp;<strong>search for agencies</strong>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>provide safari adventures</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>focus on nature trips</strong>&nbsp;to national parks.<br></li>



<li>Customization is Key A standard tour agency might offer fixed packages which can&#8217;t be changed. But a good agency will let you pick your airline, hotel, or add places to your itinerary. Tell them if you prefer a relaxing trip or one filled with activities, so they can plan accordingly. They should know the local spots well, helping you discover hidden gems. For example, Ghum India Ghum <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tour Operator in Delhi</a></strong> offers both domestic and international trips and can tailor your journey to your preferences.<br></li>



<li>Check for Certifications Make sure the tour agency is certified and follows ethical practices. In India, look for IATA (International Air Transport Association) certification as a sign of a reputable business. For example, Ghum India Ghum Tours and Travel, with over 10 years of experience, is certified by IATO, ADTOI and recognized by the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.<br></li>



<li>Understand the Costs Be cautious of tour agencies that might overcharge while providing subpar services. Watch out for agencies that insist on certain hotels or airlines; they might be getting a commission. A trustworthy agency will be clear about their package prices, what&#8217;s included and not, and their fees. Always ask about any extra costs upfront to avoid surprises.<br></li>



<li>Local Support and Guidance When traveling to new places, language can be a barrier. A connected tour agent will provide a guide or direct you to reliable help, preventing any potential issues. Ghum India Ghum has professional guides fluent in multiple languages, ensuring you have support whenever needed, even from back home.<br><br>Ghum India Ghum <strong>Tour Operators in India</strong> is a trusted agency with a variety of packages tailored to your needs. They offer 24/7 customer support and ensure a smooth travel experience. Take your time to research and choose an agency like Ghum India Ghum that meets all your travel requirements.<br>Remember, a local tour operator can offer personalized service that big online travel sites can&#8217;t match. Take your time to find one that understands your travel needs and can make your trip special.</li>

<p>Monkeys are an inevitable part of Indian history and culture. Whether you associate them with the ‘Banar Sena&#8217; or the Monkey army of Hanuman from the legend of Ramayana, or Gandhi ji mentioning the philosophy of three wise monkeys during the Swadesh movement, this specific animal has an enormous contribution to Indian cultural heritage—and Galtaji temple or Monkey Temple one of the most prominent <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">temples in Rajasthan</a> </strong>dedicated to monkeys.
