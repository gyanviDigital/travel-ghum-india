<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of Pondicherry</h2>



<p>Pondicherry, often referred to as &#8220;Puducherry&#8221; or simply &#8220;Pondy,&#8221; boasts a rich history that dates back to ancient times. The town has been influenced by various cultures over the centuries, from the Romans and Greeks to the Cholas and Vijayanagara Empire. However, the most significant period in Pondicherry&#8217;s history began with the arrival of the French in the late 17th century.</p>



<p>In 1674, the French East India Company established a trading post in Pondicherry, which eventually grew into a thriving colonial settlement. The French influence is still evident today in the town&#8217;s architecture, cuisine, and overall ambiance. Walking through the streets of the French Quarter, also known as White Town, feels like stepping back in time to a French colonial era. The grid-patterned streets, colonial buildings, and vibrant bougainvillea-covered walls add to the town&#8217;s charm.</p>



<p>Pondicherry remained under French control until 1954, when it was formally transferred to the Republic of India. Despite this change, the town has retained its unique blend of French and Indian cultures, making it a fascinating destination for history enthusiasts.</p>
