<li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Trains and buses are cost-effective ways to travel. Flights between major cities are also reasonably priced.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Paying for Things in India</h4>



<p>While credit and debit cards are widely accepted in cities, cash is still king in many rural areas and small towns. ATMs are plentiful, but it&#8217;s a good idea to carry some cash, especially for small purchases and transportation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Scams in India</h3>



<p>India is generally safe for tourists, but like any other destination, it&#8217;s essential to be aware of common scams:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Child Beggars and Other Vagrants</h4>



<p>Avoid giving money to child beggars, as it often supports a larger network. Instead, consider donating to reputable charities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. The Taxi That Wants You Is Not The Taxi You Want</h4>



<p>Always use pre-paid taxi services or ride-sharing apps like Ola and Uber to avoid overcharging. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Tour Guides (or Anything Else for That Matter) Are Rarely Ever Free</h4>



<p>If someone offers to guide you or show you something, be prepared to pay for their services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Priests of Pushkar</h4>



<p>In Pushkar, <strong>priests</strong> may offer blessings and then demand a hefty donation. Politely decline their services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Purchase All Your Own Transportation Tickets</h4>



<p>Book your tickets for trains, buses, and flights directly through official websites or <strong>authorized agents</strong> like <strong>Ghum India Ghum </strong>to avoid being scammed.</p>

<p>Most nationalities require a visa to enter India. Apply for an e-visa online, which is valid for 30 days to one year, depending on your nationality.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Reach Manali</h3>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>By Train</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The nearest railway station to this hill station is Joginder Nagar. A specific train called Kalka Mail is a viable pick. Travelling through the tunnels on Kalka Mail is scary and a remarkable experience.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Air</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Direct flights are available from Delhi and Chandigarh up to Manali, and the nearest airport is Bhuntar. This is by far the most expensive choice. Moreover, it is the fastest means of transport to reach the desired destination.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">As per our Experiences, <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel agents</a> are most important because they are the local expert on the tourist places you want to go and a good travel agent always give you simple advises for the toursim places. If you plan a hypothetical trip with a travel agent then, you have to deal with only one person throughout the tour which save your time and energy. Else you have to separately contact:- Driver, Hotels, Guides, etc.</p>
<p>When you book your tour like a <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/indian-golden-triangle-tour.php">Golden triangle package tour</a>, Rajasthan tour or Taj Mahal tours, you will definitely get good deals from renowned travel agents because all hotels give their special rates to good travel agents who have good amount business and also these rates are quite cheaper than any online portals. You will always get special attention from the hotels when you <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/hotels.php">book your hotels</a> with a travel agent comparable to an online portal. A good travel agent always works with good set of hotels from where they won’t get any complaints.</p>
<p>In Delhi, most of the good travel agents have their own fleet of transportation, which help them offering tour packages on cheaper rate than any online portal package making companies. All good companies always keep professional chauffeurs in their company and this way you won’t have to worry about the behavior of the drivers, which is very concern of all the foreign guests.</p>
<p>Tour Guides always play a very important in making your tour memorable one because if you are using the services of a knowledgeable tour guide than you will always come to know more about that place and sometime these facts and stories you won’t find on the Google. A good tour guide always gives you the honest details of their cities and also share do &amp; don’t during the city tour. And <a href="https://ghum-india-ghum-travel-agent-in-delhi.business.site/">travel agents in Delhi</a> always have contact with good guides at every place like :- Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Varanasi, etc.</p>
<p>Whenever, you are choosing a travel agent always go through their itineraries in details with inclusions, exclusions parts than kindly check their review on Trip Advisor, Yelp, Google, Facebook, etc. This way you will have a clear picture of the company and also help in making your tour memorable one.</p>
