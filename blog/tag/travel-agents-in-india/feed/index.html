</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Paying for Things in India</h4>



<p>While credit and debit cards are widely accepted in cities, cash is still king in many rural areas and small towns. ATMs are plentiful, but it&#8217;s a good idea to carry some cash, especially for small purchases and transportation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Scams in India</h3>



<p>India is generally safe for tourists, but like any other destination, it&#8217;s essential to be aware of common scams:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Child Beggars and Other Vagrants</h4>
