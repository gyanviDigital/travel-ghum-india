<li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Trains and buses are cost-effective ways to travel. Flights between major cities are also reasonably priced.</li>
</ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Paying for Things in India</h4>



<p>While credit and debit cards are widely accepted in cities, cash is still king in many rural areas and small towns. ATMs are plentiful, but it&#8217;s a good idea to carry some cash, especially for small purchases and transportation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Avoiding Scams in India</h3>



<p>India is generally safe for tourists, but like any other destination, it&#8217;s essential to be aware of common scams:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">1. Child Beggars and Other Vagrants</h4>



<p>Avoid giving money to child beggars, as it often supports a larger network. Instead, consider donating to reputable charities.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">2. The Taxi That Wants You Is Not The Taxi You Want</h4>



<p>Always use pre-paid taxi services or ride-sharing apps like Ola and Uber to avoid overcharging. </p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">3. Tour Guides (or Anything Else for That Matter) Are Rarely Ever Free</h4>



<p>If someone offers to guide you or show you something, be prepared to pay for their services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">4. Priests of Pushkar</h4>



<p>In Pushkar, <strong>priests</strong> may offer blessings and then demand a hefty donation. Politely decline their services.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">5. Purchase All Your Own Transportation Tickets</h4>



<p>Book your tickets for trains, buses, and flights directly through official websites or <strong>authorized agents</strong> like <strong>Ghum India Ghum </strong>to avoid being scammed.</p>

<p>Most nationalities require a visa to enter India. Apply for an e-visa online, which is valid for 30 days to one year, depending on your nationality.</p>

<p>Are you someone who is in love with travelling? Yes, who does not like to be amidst the beauty of nature? Stepping out from daily boring life to enjoy is something everyone craves for. Travelling gives you a feeling of relaxation, where you can freely do the adventures you want while enjoying nature. Travelling allows you to clean your mind and refreshes your soul. If you travel, you explore different people, religions, beliefs, cultures, and languages. You can learn new things and make connections with people all over the world. The best part of travelling is it broadens our horizons and opens our minds to new possibilities. Here is something we have who loves Himachal trekking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Beas Kund Trek</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Morning_beas_kund_trek.jpg" alt="Gxyd, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2713" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Morning_beas_kund_trek.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Morning_beas_kund_trek-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Morning_beas_kund_trek-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Morning_beas_kund_trek-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A journey that takes you to the source of Beas. The name Beas arrived from people who believed that rishi Vyas, who wrote Mahabharata, took his daily bath in this lake while he meditated. The term Beas kund may have derived from Vyas. Beas Kund Trek starts from Solang Nallah. Before witnessing the beautiful, serene Lake of Beas, the mesmerising meadows of Dhundi and Bakarthach will be a part of your trail on the Beas Kund trek. You can also pluck wild strawberries and mushrooms and enjoy watching herds of sheep and goats grazing grass. Beas Kund Trek is the perfect choice for you if you are a beginner because of its easy difficulty level and short duration in Himachal trekking. If you are a first-timer to himachal, hiring a <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">travel company in India</a></strong> is best to get the most out of your trip.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Duration: </strong>4 days and 3 nights</li>



<li><strong>Cost: </strong>INR5500/-</li>



<li><strong>Best time to visit: </strong>May to July and September to October</li>

<p>Hampta Pass is one of the Himalayas&#8217;s most dramatic and rare pass crossings. Along the walk, you can observe a portion of Kullu&#8217;s verdant, beautiful valley, complete with meadows, woods, and mountain flowers in bloom. On the other side, you will see barren mountains and almost no vegetation. Both the mountains are two different worlds. What makes Hampta Pass more thrilling is that when you get onto the other side, you will be mesmerised by what you left behind. The landscape in front of you is Spiti Valley. You will witness more scenic changes while crossing Hampta, and that part will be a great adventure for Himachal trekking.</p>
