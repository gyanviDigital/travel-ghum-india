<p>Are you someone who is in love with travelling? Yes, who does not like to be amidst the beauty of nature? Stepping out from daily boring life to enjoy is something everyone craves for. Travelling gives you a feeling of relaxation, where you can freely do the adventures you want while enjoying nature. Travelling allows you to clean your mind and refreshes your soul. If you travel, you explore different people, religions, beliefs, cultures, and languages. You can learn new things and make connections with people all over the world. The best part of travelling is it broadens our horizons and opens our minds to new possibilities. Here is something we have who loves Himachal trekking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Beas Kund Trek</strong></h2>

<p>A journey that takes you to the source of Beas. The name Beas arrived from people who believed that rishi Vyas, who wrote Mahabharata, took his daily bath in this lake while he meditated. The term Beas kund may have derived from Vyas. Beas Kund Trek starts from Solang Nallah. Before witnessing the beautiful, serene Lake of Beas, the mesmerising meadows of Dhundi and Bakarthach will be a part of your trail on the Beas Kund trek. You can also pluck wild strawberries and mushrooms and enjoy watching herds of sheep and goats grazing grass. Beas Kund Trek is the perfect choice for you if you are a beginner because of its easy difficulty level and short duration in Himachal trekking. If you are a first-timer to himachal, hiring a <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">travel company in India</a></strong> is best to get the most out of your trip.</p>

<p>Hampta Pass is one of the Himalayas&#8217;s most dramatic and rare pass crossings. Along the walk, you can observe a portion of Kullu&#8217;s verdant, beautiful valley, complete with meadows, woods, and mountain flowers in bloom. On the other side, you will see barren mountains and almost no vegetation. Both the mountains are two different worlds. What makes Hampta Pass more thrilling is that when you get onto the other side, you will be mesmerised by what you left behind. The landscape in front of you is Spiti Valley. You will witness more scenic changes while crossing Hampta, and that part will be a great adventure for Himachal trekking.</p>

<p>Trekking in Pin Bhaba Pass, you can witness the drama as the landscape changes from green lushes to deserted mountains. While at the pass, you see Pin Valley below you, in various shades 9of pink, while behind you is the lush green Bhaba Valley. Seeing this, you will realise how nature never fails to amaze you. You will see a turquoise-blue river gushes through the forest on one side. In the forest of mulling, the grasslands catch your breath.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Duration: 8 days, 7 nights</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cost: INR 24000/-</strong></li>



<li><strong>Best time to visit: May to October</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Spending time in the mountains can reduce your stress and anxiety. Nature has a calming effect on the brain, reducing the stress hormone cortisol levels. Engaging in physical activity in the mountains releases endorphins, also known as the &#8220;happy hormones,&#8221; which promote relaxation. The mountain is calling, so pack your bags and ready for Himachal trekking!.</p>

There are multiple ways to reach the peaceful hill station in Himachal. The modes of transport to reach Manali are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By road</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bus services are available from Shimla, Leh, and Chandigarh. It is a budget-friendly option. Also, enjoying the picturesque scenery by road can be the most suitable choice.

<ul>
<li><strong>By Train</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The nearest railway station to this hill station is Joginder Nagar. A specific train called Kalka Mail is a viable pick. Travelling through the tunnels on Kalka Mail is scary and a remarkable experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Chulgiri jain temple</strong> is surrounded by the Aravalli range, which gives you a beautiful and captivating view from the top of the hill. It is a proper blend of adventure, beautiful nature, and religiosity. Chulgiri Trek Hill is one of the most attractive places in Jaipur. Jains particularly regard Chulgiri as one of the holiest and most well-known locations in the world because a stunning white-marbled Jain temple sits perched atop the hill. Its most attractive thing is its calm nature, which gives you a soothing feeling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chulgiri Jain Temple</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="694" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2.jpg" alt="Chulgiri Jain Temple in jaipur" class="wp-image-2587" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2.jpg 694w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chulgiri-Jain-Temple-2-150x104.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></figure>



<p>In 1953, Acharya Shri Desh Bhushan Ji founded the Chulgiri Jain temple. When he reached this place, seeking peace to engage in serious meditation, and because of the area&#8217;s peace and quiet, he ultimately chose to conduct soul-searching. Following that, he constructed the &#8220;Chulgiri&#8221; Jain temple.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">About Chulgiri Hills</h3>



<p>Nestled in the Aravalli hills, next to the Ghat Ki Guni tunnel, lies the temple dedicated to Chulgiri. This is the peak of the Chulgiri trek Mountains. There are a thousand steps leading up to the temple. In 1966, sculptors created three white stone statues representing Shree Parshavnath, the Tirthankars, and Neminath. During renovations, installers added 24 additional Tirthankars and a water tank to collect prayer water. Then, in 1982, builders erected a 65-foot dome and one of Mahaveer Swami&#8217;s tallest statues, standing around 21 feet tall and carved from a single piece of white stone. Craftsmen use white marble to create this stunning temple, which features exquisite and unique decorations.</p>



<p>Chulgiri temple has diverse flora and fauna, as well as many plants, animals, and birds. Indrajeet and Kumbhakaran are believed to have prayed and meditated here in ancient times. It is a unique and historic palace if you follow Jainism. This temple is one of the famous sightseeing places in Jaipur, providing you with a magnificent view from the top. The Aravali ranges encircling the temple make it more beautiful. The Jain Chulgiri temple is a digambara shrine. Walking up to the temple is quite thrilling.</p>



<p>This temple is a special place for Jains in the Chulgiri trek hills near Jaipur&#8217;s outskirts. Chulgiri temple reflects the rich culture of Jainism in Rajasthan.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Best Time to Visit</h3>



<p>The Chulgiri Jain Temple is open to tourists year-round. You can therefore visit this temple throughout the year. Every season has its own unique beauty!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Best Season</strong>: Winter is the best time to visit Chulgiri Jain temple, particularly from October to March. In winter, the weather remains calm and pleasant, and the steps to the temple&#8217;s premises are easy to climb. It feels less exhausting in winter than in summer.</li>



<li><strong>Best Day of The Week</strong>: You should visit the Chulgiri Jain temple on weekdays. As weekends have the highest number of devotees. On weekdays, you can avoid standing in long queues at the temple and enjoy exploring the temple at your own pace.</li>



<li><strong>Best Time of The Day</strong>: Visiting the Chulgiri trek in the early morning is best.</li>
</ul>



<p>However, monsoon season is also an excellent time to visit Chulgiri Hill. You will be mesmerised to see the beauty of nature during this time. The Aravali range would be covered with lush greenery and beautiful clouds, and the scenic beauty would leave you amazed. The view from the top of Chulgiri Hill during monsoon is breathtaking.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tsuglagkhang Complex</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045.jpg" alt="Adam Jones from Kelowna, BC, Canada, CC BY-SA 2.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2551" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>You must include this place in your <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dharamshala tour packages</a></strong>.

The trail will lead you through mesmerising hillside views, prayer wheels, and prayer flags and shrines.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hanuman Tibba</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596.jpg" alt="Biswarup Ganguly, CC BY 3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2552" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you are an adventure lover, Hanuman Tibia is a must–have in your Dharamshala trip. It is the highest point in the Dhauladhar range, with an elevation of 5860 meters. The journey to the peak of Hanuman Tibba will leave you mesmerised, which is why it is every hiker&#8217;s dream. But remember, this trek is challenging; it needs lots of guts, practice, and experience. If you are a beginner, this trek is not a good choice. Witnessing the sunset from Hanuman Tibba is a treat to your eyes!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tea Gardens</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="770" height="412" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala.jpg" alt="Hotelhimalayan, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2553" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala.jpg 770w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala-768x411.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></figure>



<p>Who does not want a hot cup of tea in chilly weather? You can see the tea gardens of Dharamshala trip, with lush green landscapes and rolling hills covered with tea plantations. You can take a tour of the gardens. Besides that, you can learn about the tea-making process and taste some of the tea that is produced. Once you taste the tea, you can differentiate between local tea and Dharamshala&#8217;s tea directly from the tea gardens. Its flavour and aroma make it a must-have in at least one cup!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bhyagsunag Waterfalls</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="606" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls.jpeg" alt="Bhyagsunag Waterfalls, Dharamshala tour package," class="wp-image-2554" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls.jpeg 1000w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-300x182.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-768x465.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-150x91.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Are you among the people who love the sound of water? Then it would be best if you went to Bhyagsunag Waterfalls, situated in the quaint little village of Bhagsu. These falls are one of the most well-known and visited tourist attractions in the Dharamshala district.</p>



<p>A trekking trail takes you up to the point from where the waterfalls are. The path of the trek might be slippery; hence, the elders and children should avoid it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Embrace the beauty of nature. Dharamshala&#8217;s scenic beauty will leave you spellbound. It will soothe both your eyes and soul. Its charm will remain in you for a longer time. Dharamshala&#8217;s beauty is something that no one can resist visiting at regular intervals.</p>
