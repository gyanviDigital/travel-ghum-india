Travelling gives you a feeling of relaxation, where you can freely do the adventures you want while enjoying nature. Travelling allows you to clean your mind and refreshes your soul. If you travel, you explore different people, religions, beliefs, cultures, and languages. You can learn new things and make connections with people all over the world. The best part of travelling is it broadens our horizons and opens our minds to new possibilities. Here is something we have who loves Himachal trekking.</p>

<p>A journey that takes you to the source of Beas. The name Beas arrived from people who believed that rishi Vyas, who wrote Mahabharata, took his daily bath in this lake while he meditated.

Before witnessing the beautiful, serene Lake of Beas, the mesmerising meadows of Dhundi and Bakarthach will be a part of your trail on the Beas Kund trek. You can also pluck wild strawberries and mushrooms and enjoy watching herds of sheep and goats grazing grass. Beas Kund Trek is the perfect choice for you if you are a beginner because of its easy difficulty level and short duration in Himachal trekking. If you are a first-timer to himachal, hiring a <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">travel company in India</a></strong> is best to get the most out of your trip.</p>
