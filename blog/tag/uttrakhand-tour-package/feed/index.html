<p>Located in the heart of the mighty Himalayas, the holy town of Rishikesh is a paradox of sorts. While internationally revered as the &#8216;Yoga Capital of the World&#8217;, it&#8217;s also an adrenaline junkie&#8217;s paradise. And we&#8217;d be remiss if we didn&#8217;t let you in on this whitewater rafting secret!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Where the Ganges Roars</h3>



<p>Imagine being dwarfed by colossal, mist-laden peaks as the thunderous Ganga currents hurtle past you. Your heart&#8217;s pumping, every muscle is taut with anticipation as you await the rapids. This is level-next whitewater rafting, folks!</p>



<p>The Ganga&#8217;s frothing journey through Rishikesh is punctuated by stretches of relatively calm waters, interspersed with wild, untamed rapidsranging from grades 1 to 4+. From the gushing mouth of Shivpuri to hair-raising drops at Brahmpuri, it&#8217;s an obstacle course crafted by nature itself.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker &#8211; we know these meandering veins like the back of our hand. With over a decade of experience, our rafting expeditions are a fine-tuned balance of safety and crazy thrills!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Geared for Adventure</h3>

<p>Less travelled jungle pathways will soon be made available to trekkers and <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">tourists in Uttarakhand</a>. The Uttarakhand Forest Department is prepared to provide travellers with distinctive trekking experiences this summer, including the least travelled trek routes in the dense coniferous woods of Chakrata, geological excursions at 1000 feet in Kharamba, and stargazing in Molta.</p>

<p>In reference to this, Yamuna Circle Forest Conservator Vinay Bhargav said that they have identified 15 distinct locations in the states where hikers can go. According on their preferences and planned length of stay, the guests will be able to choose from a variety of trails, he continued. He continued by saying that one may choose between treks that range from 2.5 km in a day to 65 km in a week, where trekkers would also get to stay in homestays and wilderness camps.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unexplored-trekking-trails-available-in-Uttrakhand-from-April.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1525" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unexplored-trekking-trails-available-in-Uttrakhand-from-April.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unexplored-trekking-trails-available-in-Uttrakhand-from-April-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Unexplored-trekking-trails-available-in-Uttrakhand-from-April-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another expert said that nine of the 15 trails had been identified were rarely used by outsiders, had no human habitation, and were located in extremely dense forests. Along these pathways, visitors can also experience overnight in woodland rest homes from the British era.</p>

<p>Due to the shift in altitude, you will feel headaches during the initial 3 days of your trip. It will prevent you from enjoying the vacation and make you constantly irritable. It might rise when traveling during the day, and the constant change in altitude can be detrimental to your health. Caffeine will be your closest friend and keep you cheerful throughout the initial days. Your disposition will shift immediately. You can find many <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>tour operators for Leh</strong></a>, Ladakh, and all other North Indian states. They will help you find the best destinations based on your plans (time).</p>



<p><strong>NOTE: <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/best-places-for-shopping-in-rishikesh/">Best Places for Shopping in Rishikesh</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Carry copies of your identity document</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-most-important-travel-documents-for-your-trip-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1501" style="width:579px;height:385px" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-most-important-travel-documents-for-your-trip-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-most-important-travel-documents-for-your-trip-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-most-important-travel-documents-for-your-trip-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-most-important-travel-documents-for-your-trip-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-most-important-travel-documents-for-your-trip-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you&#8217;re an Indian citizen, you should have copies of your PAN card, AADHAR card, passport, and voter identification card. If you aren&#8217;t an Indian citizen, you must carry copies of your Ladakh travel permit and passport. A few more documents, including vehicle insurance, vehicle registration papers, a PUC, and a valid driver&#8217;s license, are required for bikers. Nowadays, you can find a list of <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>Travel Companies in Delhi</strong></a>, for Leh and Ladakh and all other places in India.</p>



<p><strong>Do hotel bookings far in advance</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="525" height="350" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Booking-Hotel.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1502" style="width:574px;height:383px" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Booking-Hotel.jpg 525w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Booking-Hotel-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></figure>



<p>Since Leh is a popular tourist destination, there is a chance that you won&#8217;t be able to book a good hotel in time. And if you tell your hotel in Ladakh ahead of time, they can set up various adventure activities for you. So, book your hotel in advance to get the most out of your trip.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid drinking alcohol</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-to-stop-drinking.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1503" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-to-stop-drinking.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-to-stop-drinking-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/How-to-stop-drinking-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ladakh does not restrict alcohol consumption, although it is recommended to avoid drinking. Caffeine is a diuretic that can cause dehydration if consumed excessively. The severity of the impacts increases with altitude. You can keep your body warm by consuming a peg.</p>



<p><strong>Plan Travel at Night</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="684" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plan-Travel-at-Night-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1504" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plan-Travel-at-Night-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plan-Travel-at-Night-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plan-Travel-at-Night-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plan-Travel-at-Night-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plan-Travel-at-Night-2048x1368.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ladakh has lovely nights, with billions of stars looking upon you. The sky is so transparent that the milky way can be seen with the naked eye. However, it is not advised to go to Leh at night. One reason is that the water flow in the rivers crossing the roadways increases at night, making crossing them hazardous. Another cause is that the streets are lonely, making it difficult to obtain assistance in an emergency. However, if you want to go at night, you should do so in a group, not alone. You can hire the best <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>Travel Agents in Delhi</strong></a> for Leh, Ladakh or other famous destination to make the tour effortless.</p>



<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/best-place-to-visit-in-kashmir-truly-paradise-on-earth/">Best Place to Visit in Kashmir, Truly Paradise on Earth</a></strong></p>



<p><strong>Respect nature and the locals</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="879" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Respect-nature-and-the-locals.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1505" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Respect-nature-and-the-locals.jpg 879w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Respect-nature-and-the-locals-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Respect-nature-and-the-locals-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></figure>



<p>Last but not least, you must respect nature and the residents with respect. You need not argue with them regarding their opinions and ideas because they&#8217;ll have a different perspective. You should hire a local guide, so you don&#8217;t miss out on the incredible local tales they have in store. Animals can become frightened if you approach them too closely in national parks. Preserve the region&#8217;s magnificence by not picking flowers.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>A trip to Ladakh is akin to a road to the paradise in the Himalayas. We hope our Ladakh travel guide may assist you on that trip. Every 10 kilometers, there is a different mountain landscape. Plan your vacation to Ladakh as soon as possible, and you will have the greatest time of your life. However, to make your trip easy, you can take the best package from reputed companies like <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">ghumindiaghum</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Rishikesh, in the stunning Indian state of Uttarakhand, is home to many exciting experiences. Using this guide, you may learn more about the best outdoor pursuits available in Rishikesh. So, now is the time to pack your luggage and go off on a trip with the help of <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel agents in Delhi</a></strong>, to Rishikesh to enjoy the sights and sounds of this peaceful city.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="779" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1430" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour.jpg 1000w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour-768x598.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Do some hiking in the Himalayas</strong></p>



<p>Visiting Rishikesh through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel agencies in Delhi</a></strong> would be incomplete without getting out into the surrounding mountains. Many nearby hill stations, including Sattal, Dehradun, and Kanatal, may be visited via trek, with distances varying according to your fitness level.</p>



<p>If you are interested in doing something a little bit more difficult, then maybe the Valley of Flowers Trek or the Kunjapuri Trek would be more to your liking. In addition, the area is home to some spectacular waterfall walks that will lead you to some of the region&#8217;s most breathtaking views. Given its convenience, the Neer Garh Waterfall is likely to draw the most crowds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="410" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ganga-Aarti-at-Triveni-Ghat-in-Rishikesh-russavia-flickr.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1431" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ganga-Aarti-at-Triveni-Ghat-in-Rishikesh-russavia-flickr.jpg 700w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ganga-Aarti-at-Triveni-Ghat-in-Rishikesh-russavia-flickr-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Attending the Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat Will Captivate You</strong></p>



<p>Rishikesh is a city with two distinct personalities: one is hyperactive, and the other is calm. Attend the Ganga Aarti in Rishikesh to experience the city&#8217;s other side and learn about the city&#8217;s thriving Hindu culture and traditions.</p>



<p>After the sun goes down, the ghats are illuminated by hundreds of furious lights, inviting your soul to get acquainted with the quiet side of this action-packed city. This is one of the unique activities available in Rishikesh.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="851" height="521" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1432" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting.jpg 851w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" /></figure>



<p><strong>River Rafting</strong></p>



<p>Located on the Ganga River and close to the Himalayas, Rishikesh is a fantastic rafting destination. Recent times have seen a rise in participation in the activity. Any person looking for an adventure will find their needs met by participating in this sport through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel companies in India</a></strong>. However, there&#8217;s a whole other level of thrill to be had in the brisk Ganga waters.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="731" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1433" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Spend some time at the Beatles&#8217; Ashram</strong></p>



<p>Contrary to what most people may believe, The Beatles had a significant history with Rishikesh. The Beatles traveled to Rishikesh several times because the place had a special allure. Rishikesh is known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the world. This was where many of their tunes first took shape.</p>



<p>Although the Ashram has been left in disrepair, it has several artworks and writings describing the Beatles&#8217; stay in India and their association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Tour operators in Delhi</a></strong>, this is a must-see for every die-hard Beatles fan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bungee-Jumping.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1434" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bungee-Jumping.jpg 720w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bungee-Jumping-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Bungee Jumping</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the various exciting activities in Rishikesh, bungee jumping is a must if you want to feel a true rush of excitement. Bungee jumping is free falling from a great height while attached to a rope harness or cable around your ankles and the rest of your body. One thing that makes bungee jumping so thrilling is the free fall period you have before the cable begins to rebound and pulls you back up.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Moreover, if you&#8217;re looking to satisfy your need for adventure, nature, or spirituality, Rishikesh is one of the greatest cities in India to accomplish it. This guide to the top attractions in Rishikesh is a great starting point for planning an unforgettable trip through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel companies in Delhi</a></strong>.</p>
