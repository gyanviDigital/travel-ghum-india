One should only go river rafting in a helmet or life jacket to avoid accidents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Hot air Balloon ride</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali.jpg" alt="Hot air Balloon ride manali,Best Manali Adventure Sports," class="wp-image-2668" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hot-air-Balloon-ride-manali-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>Manali is also a trekker&#8217;s heaven. One may choose a companion or trek along, keeping the Himalayas and Pine Trees at bay between the forests for an incredible sight amongst the mountains.

Trekking lets you enjoy the essence of sunset and sunrise, closely peeping through the mountains.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to Reach Manali</h3>



<p><strong>Ghum India Ghum</strong>, a leading <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tour and travel company in Delhi</a></strong> will arrange these packages along with other destinations of your choice. There are multiple ways to reach the peaceful hill station in Himachal. The modes of transport to reach Manali are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By road</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Bus services are available from Shimla, Leh, and Chandigarh. It is a budget-friendly option. Also, enjoying the picturesque scenery by road can be the most suitable choice. It is better to skip this option, as it might take longer hours to reach if someone travels by road with kids or senior citizens.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Train</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The nearest railway station to this hill station is Joginder Nagar. A specific train called Kalka Mail is a viable pick. Travelling through the tunnels on Kalka Mail is scary and a remarkable experience.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>By Air</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Direct flights are available from Delhi and Chandigarh up to Manali, and the nearest airport is Bhuntar. This is by far the most expensive choice. Moreover, it is the fastest means of transport to reach the desired destination.</p>



<p>The white abode of magnificent peaks coupled with green valleys, rivers, waterfalls, wildlife tours, whether on a solo trip or with family and ever-so-pleasant weather, is everything you get in a trip to <strong>Best Manali Adventure Sports</strong>. Finally, also known as the &#8220;Land of God,&#8221; Manali is widely famous for its rich flora and fauna. Likewise, its mesmerising glory is a sight to behold for a lifetime.
