										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rishikesh, in the stunning Indian state of Uttarakhand, is home to many exciting experiences. Using this guide, you may learn more about the best outdoor pursuits available in Rishikesh. So, now is the time to pack your luggage and go off on a trip with the help of <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel agents in Delhi</a></strong>, to Rishikesh to enjoy the sights and sounds of this peaceful city.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="779" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1430" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour.jpg 1000w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour-300x234.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rishikesh-tour-768x598.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Do some hiking in the Himalayas</strong></p>



<p>Visiting Rishikesh through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel agencies in Delhi</a></strong> would be incomplete without getting out into the surrounding mountains. Many nearby hill stations, including Sattal, Dehradun, and Kanatal, may be visited via trek, with distances varying according to your fitness level.</p>



<p>If you are interested in doing something a little bit more difficult, then maybe the Valley of Flowers Trek or the Kunjapuri Trek would be more to your liking. In addition, the area is home to some spectacular waterfall walks that will lead you to some of the region&#8217;s most breathtaking views. Given its convenience, the Neer Garh Waterfall is likely to draw the most crowds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="700" height="410" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ganga-Aarti-at-Triveni-Ghat-in-Rishikesh-russavia-flickr.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1431" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ganga-Aarti-at-Triveni-Ghat-in-Rishikesh-russavia-flickr.jpg 700w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Ganga-Aarti-at-Triveni-Ghat-in-Rishikesh-russavia-flickr-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Attending the Ganga Aarti at Triveni Ghat Will Captivate You</strong></p>



<p>Rishikesh is a city with two distinct personalities: one is hyperactive, and the other is calm. Attend the Ganga Aarti in Rishikesh to experience the city&#8217;s other side and learn about the city&#8217;s thriving Hindu culture and traditions.</p>



<p>After the sun goes down, the ghats are illuminated by hundreds of furious lights, inviting your soul to get acquainted with the quiet side of this action-packed city. This is one of the unique activities available in Rishikesh.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="851" height="521" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1432" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting.jpg 851w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/River-Rafting-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" /></figure>



<p><strong>River Rafting</strong></p>



<p>Located on the Ganga River and close to the Himalayas, Rishikesh is a fantastic rafting destination. Recent times have seen a rise in participation in the activity. Any person looking for an adventure will find their needs met by participating in this sport through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel companies in India</a></strong>. However, there&#8217;s a whole other level of thrill to be had in the brisk Ganga waters.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="731" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1433" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2-768x548.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Beatles-Ashram-LIB-2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Spend some time at the Beatles&#8217; Ashram</strong></p>



<p>Contrary to what most people may believe, The Beatles had a significant history with Rishikesh. The Beatles traveled to Rishikesh several times because the place had a special allure. Rishikesh is known for being one of the most beautiful cities in the world. This was where many of their tunes first took shape.</p>



<p>Although the Ashram has been left in disrepair, it has several artworks and writings describing the Beatles&#8217; stay in India and their association with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Tour operators in Delhi</a></strong>, this is a must-see for every die-hard Beatles fan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bungee-Jumping.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1434" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bungee-Jumping.jpg 720w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Bungee-Jumping-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Bungee Jumping</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the various exciting activities in Rishikesh, bungee jumping is a must if you want to feel a true rush of excitement. Bungee jumping is free falling from a great height while attached to a rope harness or cable around your ankles and the rest of your body. One thing that makes bungee jumping so thrilling is the free fall period you have before the cable begins to rebound and pulls you back up.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Moreover, if you&#8217;re looking to satisfy your need for adventure, nature, or spirituality, Rishikesh is one of the greatest cities in India to accomplish it. This guide to the top attractions in Rishikesh is a great starting point for planning an unforgettable trip through <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Travel companies in Delhi</a></strong>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga-meditation-rishikesh.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-580" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga-meditation-rishikesh.jpg 640w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga-meditation-rishikesh-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></figure>



<p>The union of the existence with the non existence is yoga. It is a practice which expands beyond the physical aerobics and furthers itself beyond spirituality. That which remains is yoga. Yoga is Truth.</p>



<p>Note:- <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/the-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-film-theme-based-tour-package/"><strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel film Theme Based Tour Package</strong></a></p>



<p>India (Bharat) is the birth place of this holy practice of yoga.
However, truth cannot have a beginning or an end. This is because truth is
absolute. If a statement is relative, then it is not the truth, as it is
subject to change with the movement of time. Hence, yoga has forever existed
and will forever exist. For the clarity of understanding as far as the human
intellect can fathom, its propagation began in the holy subcontinent of India (Bharat).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-1024x640.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-581" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga24.jpg 1680w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ancient Rishis (sages) propagated this enlightening knowledge to those
who were fit to practice it. Those who wanted to acquire this knowledge were
fit to practice and hence experienced the revolutionary benefits of yoga. This
is the knowledge for which millions of people from all around the world travel
to different parts of Bharat. As it is Truth, it has no religious boundaries.
For this reason, Bharat experiences a diversity in the population interested to
gain the wisdom of the Yoga and the Vedic scriptures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="912" height="650" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-582" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1.jpg 912w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga1-768x547.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" /></figure>



<p>It is important that we understand the importance of India for the learning of yoga and other Bharatiya (Indian) spiritual practices. As its point of propagation and consistent practice which is integrated into the culture, the yogic wisdom remains unadulterated here. It is here that great teachers aid in the revaluation of the truth. And it is here that has the spiritual infrastructure to sustain such a spiritual growth. India have to offer lot of <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com">Yoga tour in india</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-1024x576.jpg" alt="Yoga Tourism in India, yoga tour in Rishikesh, Yoga Teacher Training in India, travel agents in delhi, tour operator in delhi, uttarakhand tour package" class="wp-image-583" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/yoga22-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For this reason, Bharat is an apt destination for the evolution of
the self in the spiritual paradigm. </p>



<p>Every year, thousands of courses are arranged so that the truth can
be spread for the benefit of the world and it has become a observable success.
Bharat invites the world to learn and elevate themselves for the benefit of the
self, for the benefit of the Nation, and for the benefit of the World. Yoga
tourism&nbsp; in India is next big thing in
Indian tourism market govt is also very serious&nbsp;
