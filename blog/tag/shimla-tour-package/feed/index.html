<p>Do you know that Dharamshala is known as the winter capital of Kangra district? God blesses us with a pleasant climate during summer as well. The perfect time for you to visit Dharamshala is from the end of March till the end of June. If you want to explore, the mornings and the afternoons are perfect for you as they give you a balmy feeling of weather. The weather will slightly change when the sun sets. But do not worry about it! It won&#8217;t get frosty; you can expect little rainfall and hailstorms from May onwards.</p>



<p>But if you plan to visit during the monsoon season, it is not a good idea, from July to September, as there is a high risk of landslides.</p>



<p>However, if you are an adventure enthusiast, the winter months of December to February are best for you.</p>



<p>If you love to enjoy the serenity and want a peaceful retreat, then March to April and October to November give you tranquil moments. You know, Dharamshala is a year-round destination that attracts every type of traveller throughout the year.</p>

<p>Namgyal Monastery is one of the world&#8217;s largest and most beautiful monasteries. Around 200 monks live in this monastery. Monks who live there organise peaceful and soulful prayers and meditation sessions, making this place a peace lover&#8217;s paradise. When you are in Dharamshala, this monastery is a must to pay a visit as it is Dalai Lama&#8217;s home.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tsuglagkhang Complex</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045.jpg" alt="Adam Jones from Kelowna, BC, Canada, CC BY-SA 2.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2551" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Interior_of_Tsuglagkhang_Complex_-_McLeod_Ganj_-_Himachal_Pradesh_-_India_26775198045-150x113.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>You must include this place in your <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dharamshala tour packages</a></strong>.

The trail will lead you through mesmerising hillside views, prayer wheels, and prayer flags and shrines.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hanuman Tibba</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596.jpg" alt="Biswarup Ganguly, CC BY 3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2552" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596-768x511.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1024px-Mount_Hanuman_Tibba_-_Solang_Valley_-_Kullu_2014-05-10_2596-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If you are an adventure lover, Hanuman Tibia is a must–have in your Dharamshala trip. It is the highest point in the Dhauladhar range, with an elevation of 5860 meters. The journey to the peak of Hanuman Tibba will leave you mesmerised, which is why it is every hiker&#8217;s dream. But remember, this trek is challenging; it needs lots of guts, practice, and experience. If you are a beginner, this trek is not a good choice. Witnessing the sunset from Hanuman Tibba is a treat to your eyes!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tea Gardens</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="770" height="412" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala.jpg" alt="Hotelhimalayan, CC BY-SA 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons" class="wp-image-2553" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala.jpg 770w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala-300x161.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala-768x411.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kangra_Tea_Garden_Is_The_Best_Visit_Place_Of_Dharamshala-150x80.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></figure>



<p>Who does not want a hot cup of tea in chilly weather? You can see the tea gardens of Dharamshala trip, with lush green landscapes and rolling hills covered with tea plantations. You can take a tour of the gardens. Besides that, you can learn about the tea-making process and taste some of the tea that is produced. Once you taste the tea, you can differentiate between local tea and Dharamshala&#8217;s tea directly from the tea gardens. Its flavour and aroma make it a must-have in at least one cup!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bhyagsunag Waterfalls</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="606" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls.jpeg" alt="Bhyagsunag Waterfalls, Dharamshala tour package," class="wp-image-2554" style="aspect-ratio:3/2;object-fit:cover" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls.jpeg 1000w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-300x182.jpeg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-768x465.jpeg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bhyagsunag-Waterfalls-150x91.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>Are you among the people who love the sound of water? Then it would be best if you went to Bhyagsunag Waterfalls, situated in the quaint little village of Bhagsu. These falls are one of the most well-known and visited tourist attractions in the Dharamshala district.</p>



<p>A trekking trail takes you up to the point from where the waterfalls are. The path of the trek might be slippery; hence, the elders and children should avoid it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Embrace the beauty of nature. Dharamshala&#8217;s scenic beauty will leave you spellbound. It will soothe both your eyes and soul. Its charm will remain in you for a longer time. Dharamshala&#8217;s beauty is something that no one can resist visiting at regular intervals.</p>
