<p>Hiring the best travel agency is always the best option for everyone to keep their trip completely entertained. Even though there are many travel companies in India, it is not easy to find the best one without the right knowledge. There are risks of getting conned or fed with wrong or misleading information. Such potential risks can ruin your travel plans.</p>



<p><strong>Why do we choose Travel Agents at All?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We choose Travel Agents when we decide on going on a tour because &#8211;</p>



<ul>
<li>They help people plan a tour.</li>



<li>The travel agency helps people choose from a broad periphery.</li>



<li>Then they always arrange everything that&#8217;s planned at the right time.&nbsp;</li>



<li>They work on a given budget and customize itineraries.</li>



<li>The travel agents often suggest where to go and talk about local tourist attractions and their customs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to Pick the Right Travel Agent</strong></p>



<p>Choosing a travel agency may seem easy for many people, but it will not be the same for everyone, mostly foreigners planning a visit to India. They can easily fall into the traps of fake travel agencies or may unnecessarily waste money, time, and effort. Unbelievable deals, limited availability, and unverified reviews are some red flags. To make sure it won’t happen, hiring reputed <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">travel agents in India</a></strong> like Ghum India Ghum is the best choice for them. They also offer more personalized tour plans compared to other agencies. Some important tips for choosing the best travel company are the following.</p>



<p><strong>● Check whether the travel company that you choose is genuine via good research.</strong></p>



<p>The primary thing to consider while choosing a travel company is whether it is genuine. Nowadays, all the details of travel companies are available online, making it easier for an individual to decide whether it is natural. You might have heard about the travel agent you are trying to fix from Google, social media, or some friend. But have you checked on the agent&#8217;s authenticity? Does this travel agent have a website that talks about the services they provide? Do the services offered match your expectations? If they don’t have a proper website, it speaks volumes about the company and its online credibility. Always keep that in mind while searching for the right travel agent. Good research by checking customer reviews will also provide additional knowledge for finding the best <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">tour operators India</a></strong>. Choosing a high-rated agency can offer you the best results.</p>



<p><strong>Must to check things: </strong>Look for genuine and verified customer reviews on reputable platforms. Use agencies that offer secure and standard payment methods.</p>



<p><strong>● Try to find out whether the travel agency has enough experience with all the tourist destinations and provides the correct recommendations.</strong></p>



<p>Choosing a travel company with a well-experienced team is much more important than knowing the best tourist destinations. Only the experienced agents will see the beauty of a tourist destination, the facilities offered in a hotel, etc. You might diligently do your research work for your trips. But when dealing with a travel agency, you need to know how experienced their team is to have a top-class experience. Whether it is choosing the place, the area to live, the best hotels and homestays, the food offers that come along with accommodation, the transport services available for easy transfers, the tourist spots around the place, local museums or eateries and shops to visit &#8211; everything should be known by the travel agency. They should offer the tourists assistance and knowledge with the best ideas to make the trip memorable and worth the money. </p>



<p><strong>Must to Check Things:- </strong>Prioritize agencies with a proven track record and years of experience in the travel industry. Consider agencies with expertise in the specific type of travel or destination you are interested in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="651" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ensure-that-the-travel-company-holds-a-valid-certification-1024x651.jpg" alt="Ensure that the travel company holds a valid certification" class="wp-image-2216" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ensure-that-the-travel-company-holds-a-valid-certification-1024x651.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ensure-that-the-travel-company-holds-a-valid-certification-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ensure-that-the-travel-company-holds-a-valid-certification-768x488.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ensure-that-the-travel-company-holds-a-valid-certification-1536x977.jpg 1536w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ensure-that-the-travel-company-holds-a-valid-certification.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>● Ensure that the travel company holds a valid certification</strong></p>



<p>You should always ensure that your travel agent is appropriately certified and regulated. They should be the one who is operating a legitimate business ethically. It is an essential clause to remember. Your travel agent should be working in a certified way both from state and local regulatory bodies. There are many tourist spots that, when booked through an agency, might require valid authentication. At that time, if they fail to provide so or you fail to provide the existence of the booked agency, your tour might get cancelled, which will incur a massive loss of money, time, and attachment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Must to Check things</strong>: Check if the agency uses recognized industry certifications or affiliations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>● Check the cost of the service offered by the travel agency.</strong></p>



<p>There are hundreds of travel agencies in the market today. It is essential to pick the right travel agent out of all that. And when you are conflicted about choosing the best travel company in India, you might be in a dilemma. But it is pretty straightforward. One of the most critical factors of a successful vacation is the budget. A good location would suffice. You need to have the money to spend on a luxurious place. But spending money on water is not the solution. You need to have a budget first. Then, you need to research good travel agencies that will present you with the right plan that fits your budget. That&#8217;s the key. That&#8217;s how you can choose your travel agent. If they provide you with your dream package with little tweaks here and there in the given budget, that means they are capable of good service. While considering the cost, try to choose a travel agency that offers their service at a reasonable price.</p>



<p><strong>Must to Check things</strong>: Ensure transparent and detailed information about costs and any hidden fees.</p>



<p><strong>● Choose a travel agency with agents capable of fluent communication with you.</strong></p>



<p>Good communication is always necessary to express your interest to the tour guide. Sometimes, travel agencies may not have agents fluent in every language (foreign languages). So, you can avoid them at all costs to find the best travel company where you can find a suitable tour guide. Good communication means good customer service. Customers have quite a handful of requirements and even demands. And why not? They invest their hard-earned money for a good trip for relaxation, refreshment, and enrichment of their memories. Thus, when you end up with a handful of online or friends&#8217; recommended travel agents, you should prioritize good communication as a critical pointer to choose the one!&nbsp;</p>



<p>They should understand your emotions, words, and thoughts you are trying to depict. They should try their best to talk with you and understand your requirements like whether you want AC rooms, Indian food or Chinese or Continental, or you want a double bed or a King size bed, or you want one eight-seater car or two four-seater cars, or you want bed and breakfast packages or Airbnb or a suit &#8211; they should communicate openly to understand all of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They need to be polite, humble, kind, helpful and patient. These are the key factors when choosing the best travel company in India. Knowing more languages and being able to help in translations is a beneficial and crucial key point in the whole journey. They should be available over the phone and message in case of emergencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still wondering <strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">which is the best travel company in India</a></strong>. Add in a few more important key points to remember while you think about picking the right travel agent! Keep on reading to get a clear idea for choosing the best travel company for your next trip.</p>



<p><strong>• Your travel agent has a good reputation and history in selling their product and services</strong></p>



<p>Travel agents might not be travelling to various places. They might not be going for all the tours and tourist attraction sites. It is not always possible for them to have real-time experiences and knowledge to share based on which they can recommend to tourists. But they should have the experiences from what they sold, i.e., the trips they designed and customized for their clients and the dealings they made with vendors like hotels, transport offices, restaurants, flight companies and railways. This type of history is valuable enough to qualify them as one of the best travel agents in the country. The more the experiences, the more their chances of getting chosen by clients to customize their trips. It is advisable always to hold on to those travel agents with a rich history of such experiences. They come in handy with many excellent and helpful contacts and can offer you the best deals for your dream location.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>● Personally experienced Travel Agents.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, it is not always possible for travel companies to experience places to recommend and customize plans for their clients based on that. But if they have that kind of experience and knowledge directly from the sites, it can be a bonus for a fantastic itinerary. Of course, years of experience are enough. Still, it becomes easier to deal with the ones who travelled to those places, and based on personal experiences, they construct the plans for their clients, giving the best-case scenarios and minute details of the site. In this way, it gets more intimate.</p>



<p><strong>● Stay local if possible.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There are many travel agencies that you will encounter online. But still, it would be best if you stay local. There is nothing wrong with online dealings with travel agencies, but to meet, to look in the eyes of the travel agent and to shake hands and discuss the travel package over some tea and coffee &#8211; makes the experience more personal and trustworthy. Go for agencies where, if you can&#8217;t meet, you can talk through them at any moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>● Interviewing the agent could make picking the right travel agent easy.</strong></p>



<p>Do not book the first travel company you find suitable. Give some time. First, pick a handful of travel agents who meet your criteria. Then, it is best to interview them individually in their office or at your home. Look at the way they offer you help in choosing the best plan. Are they too pushy in selling their packages, or are they all relaxed and focused on getting the best deals for you? Do they focus on what you want or force their plans on you instead? These things will surely make you choose the best travel company in India!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>● Pick the right travel agent by finding their actions under pressure.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The success of a trip cannot be predicted at all. So many factors are involved here, so it is impossible to say beforehand that the trip would be perfect. That is why tourists book travel agents to design their journey and remove all their responsibilities and tensions. But there is no guarantee that those travel agents would not mess up! Yes, they very much can. How they handle these issues with urgency at any given time makes them unique and indispensable. While still talking with them about the plans and littlest details, check how they deal with problematic issues and how fast they resolve them. This will help you pick the right agent for your travel trips!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Good travel agents are always in high demand, as they are the best in the market for anyone related to travel, knowing precisely what you want and delivering it flawlessly. They speak your language. They know how to mould you. They win your trust and heart. They know the exact right words to say for you. They are always there with you when you run into trouble. Thus, expert travel agents are not obsolete and are always in demand due to their quality work.&nbsp;<br>Choosing the best travel agency can be challenging for many people if they don’t know much about them. Some fake websites or apps may be misleading you by showing wrong information about the places or making false claims. The best way to have a safe and transparent trip is to choose the right travel agency or website that contains all the necessary information about your destination. Only by gathering authentic information about a place can you plan a comfortable journey. All those facing such a situation can use the information provided here to find&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>which is The Best Travel Company in India</strong>.</a></p>

<p>Travelers from India! What&#8217;s stopping you from leaving India, visiting blue beaches, trekking up imposing hills, exploring ancient monuments, and feasting on exotic food? While many countries have yet to reopen borders due to the Omicron strain, there are many others that are eager to welcome your wanderlust soul openly, with safety, of course. So, here are six countries that are now reopening to Indian tourists. Ghum India Ghum being a leading&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">travel agents in Delhi</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>Tour operators for India</strong></a>&nbsp;is here with a recent travel update.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bali-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1127" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bali-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bali-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bali-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/bali.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Bali</strong><br>India&#8217;s favourite vacation spot Bali will soon reopen its doors to tourists. While Bali officially opened to visitors from Japan, China, New Zealand, and a few other countries in mid-October, there haven&#8217;t been enough direct flights. Bali, known for its lush green paddy fields, beautiful beaches, and ancient structures, is a popular tourist destination among Indians. While this is welcome news, it comes amid a steady rise in Covid-19 cases in Indonesia, so make an informed travel decision.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="493" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Philippines.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1128" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Philippines.jpg 740w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Philippines-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Philippines</strong><br>From February 10 the Philippines has started welcoming visitors from 157 countries around the world. The Southeast Asian country had planned to reopen its borders in December, but the decision was postponed due to an increase in Covid-19 cases. According to Presidential Spokesperson Karlo Nograles, fully vaccinated foreign nationals can enter the Philippines for tourism and business purposes if they arrive from a country on the Executive Order 408 list or a non-visa required country. The country has also waived mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated foreign visitors and Filipinos who test Covid negative.

<p><strong>Singapore</strong><br>People planning a trip to Singapore can now do so thanks to the relaxation of travel restrictions. According to the most recent travel guidelines, mandatory Covid tests and testing for vaccinated passengers have been eliminated. Furthermore, vaccinated tourists in Singapore are exempt from testing. If vaccinated travellers experience mild symptoms, they are isolated for 7 days instead of the previous 10 days so that children can recover at home.</p>

<p><strong>Thailand</strong><br>If you&#8217;ve been wanting to visit Thailand&#8217;s stunning beach and adventure paradise, now is your chance. The country will soon offer vaccinated travellers a quarantine waiver, as well as relax more rules for tourists, including offering quarantine-free travel beginning February 1. International tourists who are planning to visit Thailand should apply for the &#8216;Test &amp; Go&#8217; entry programme, which has begun from February 1st. However, there is a catch: upon arrival in Thailand, you must be prepared to undergo not one, but two Covid tests. <strong><a href="https://www.thenoidahotel.com/">The Noida Corporate Suite is best 3 star hotel in noida sector 62</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Vietnam</strong><br>Travel enthusiasts, if Vietnam is on your bucket list, it&#8217;s about time your wishes were answered. That is exactly what has occurred. Vietnam reopened its doors to international tourists on January 1. They must, however, show proof that they have been fully vaccinated or that they have recovered from the coronavirus. Travelers must undergo Covid-19 tests before flying to Vietnam, followed by a three-day quarantine at hotels and another PCR test. If your test results are negative, you must continue to monitor your health for the next two weeks.</p>

<p><strong>United Kingdom</strong><br>Following the success of vaccination and booster programmes, the United Kingdom has relaxed travel restrictions to the point where testing requirements will be completely removed for all eligible fully vaccinated travellers. The new rules went into effect on February 11th. Furthermore, the United Kingdom will allow unvaccinated travellers, but they must undergo a pre-departure test and PCR test on or before the second day after landing in England.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The ancient sites you might not have heard about but definitely worth the visit!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cultural and historical tourism. Let us take you on a journey to ten of the best ancient sites to visit that are widely unknown.</p>
<p><strong>1:- Pula, Croatia</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-287 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pula-Croatia-300x225.jpg" alt="Pula, Croatia" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pula-Croatia-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pula-Croatia-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pula-Croatia.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The Roman amphitheatre in Pula is among the six largest Roman arenas in the world and the only one with the full three levels preserved as well as the four side towers. It is also the largest Roman site in Croatia, and its unique position overlooking the harbour and the sparkling waters of the Adriatic make it the perfect spot to visit if you are crazy about Roman history and beautiful vistas.</p>
<p><strong>2:- Fatehpur Sikri, India</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-289 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Fatehpur-Sikri-India-300x201.jpg" alt="Fatehpur Sikri, India" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Fatehpur-Sikri-India-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Fatehpur-Sikri-India.jpg 760w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This perfectly preserved, surrounded by high walls mongolian city is located just 40 km westwards from India’s main tourist destination – <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">Taj Mahal Tour</a>. So if you have the time to spare you should definitely include it in your tour. The city was built by the emperor Akbar in the last quarter of the 16th century and served as the mongolian capital of India for fourteen years.</p>
<p><strong>3:- The Vatican Necropolis</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-290 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Vatican-Necropolis-300x191.jpg" alt="The Vatican Necropolis" width="300" height="191" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Vatican-Necropolis-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Vatican-Necropolis.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>When you hear Rome you almost instantly think of the Colosseum and the Pantheon. But beneath the city streets lies a whole different city – the world of the catacombs also known as the Vatican Necropolis. It is an almost surreal journey back in time, with one of the most modern cities of Europe some feet above and centuries of history all around you. According to legend Apostle Peter was buried here, alongside many of the victims of the Nero’s trials against Christians.</p>
<p><strong>4:- Koh Ker Temple, Cambodia</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-291 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Koh-Ker-Temple-Cambodia-300x189.jpg" alt="Koh Ker Temple, Cambodia" width="300" height="189" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Koh-Ker-Temple-Cambodia-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Koh-Ker-Temple-Cambodia-768x484.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Koh-Ker-Temple-Cambodia.jpg 798w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Conquered by the surrounding jungle, desolated for over a thousand years, Koh Ker looks like an eerie temple from one of the Indiana Jones movies. Often dubbed Angkor Wat’s little brother, Koh Ker is much less known and therefore much less visited than the larger temple complex, which actually is just two hours away.</p>
<p><strong>5:- Takht-e Sulaiman, Iran</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-292 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Takht-e-Sulaiman-Iran-300x153.jpg" alt="Takht-e Sulaiman, Iran" width="300" height="153" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Takht-e-Sulaiman-Iran-300x153.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Takht-e-Sulaiman-Iran-768x391.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Takht-e-Sulaiman-Iran.jpg 773w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>There is something unreal about this site, high above sea level, located on the shore of a crater lake about 180-feet deep. The earliest buildings are dated in the Sassanid period (3rd-7th century AD). Among the most imposing ruins are those of an early zoroastrian temple and a Mongolian palace from the 13th century, surrounded by walls and bastions.</p>
<p><strong>6:- Choquequirao, Peru</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-293 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Choquequirao-Peru-300x199.jpg" alt="Choquequirao, Peru" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Choquequirao-Peru-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Choquequirao-Peru-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Choquequirao-Peru.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Often called Machu Picchu’s little brother, Choquequirao is all about the adventure and the exotic of a place hardly touched by modern civilization. Unlike Maccu Picchu, which is visited by hundreds of people on a daily basis, this small Inca town gets only 300 visitors per year. And there is a good reason for that – the journey takes two days across the mountain jungles of Peru, some 9000 feet above sea level. But once you reach it you will be awarded by the peace and ethereal silence of a place that still lives with the memories of the last Incas, some six centuries ago. This destination is only for people who are not afraid to take on the unknown.</p>
<p><strong>7:- Conimbriga, Portugal</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-294 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Conimbriga-Portugal-300x213.jpg" alt="Conimbriga, Portugal" width="300" height="213" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Conimbriga-Portugal-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Conimbriga-Portugal-768x546.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Conimbriga-Portugal.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Arguably the most important archaeological site from the Roman era, Conimbriga used to be a flourishing trading city during the Roman reign, and while not the biggest, it is the best preserved ancient site in the country. The archaeologists have excavated only a fraction of the city but you can still see more than enough – lavishing baths, houses, public squares and the ruins of temples. There is also the ever present forum and the amphitheatre. The most important place to visit is the famous Casa de Cantaber – one of the largest single houses ever found in the Western half of the Roman empire, built around lavishing inner pools and gardens. Conimbriga also boasts with homely little restaurants and open spaces for picnics, so it is the perfect place to visit with the whole family.</p>
<p><strong>8:- Ani, Turkey</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-296 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ani-Turkey-300x201.jpg" alt="Ani, Turkey" width="300" height="201" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ani-Turkey-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ani-Turkey-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ani-Turkey.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>East Turkey has some hidden historical jewels and Ani is one of the most precious of them. Once the great capital of the Armenian Kingdom, now only the ruins remind the travelers of the glorious past. The city reached its zenith during the 10-11th century and was an important stop on the great trade routes of Asia Minor, with a population fo over 100 000 people. The city was almost completely destroyed by the great earthquake of 1319, but you can still see the imposing remians of great churches, a zoroastrian temple of fire and the Royal palace.</p>
<p><strong>9:- Pela, Jordan</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-297 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pela-Jordan-300x188.jpg" alt="Pela, Jordan" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pela-Jordan-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pela-Jordan-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pela-Jordan-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pela-Jordan.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Inhabited since the dawn of time, Pela is literary an archaeological treasure, with monumental ruins of Roman temples and Byzantine churches as well as an even older philistine temple, dated ca. 1700 B.C. The valley around the river Jordan offered perfect conditions for agriculture and there were settlements in the region as early as the neolit. The latest excavations have confirmed early stone walls some five thousand years old!</p>
<p><strong>10:- Han Yan Ling, China</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-298 aligncenter" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Han-Yan-Ling-China-300x200.jpg" alt="Han Yan Ling, China" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Han-Yan-Ling-China-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Han-Yan-Ling-China-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Han-Yan-Ling-China.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>You have probably heard of the great teracota army of the Sian emperors. Well, this is its miniscule version. It is the burial place of emperor Jing Di who died in 141 B.C. The local museum is splendid, with steel walls offering full view of the collections and the gathered artifacts. Every statue originally had a different face  and was dressed in matching garments. All this is gone now but the nearby museum offers some great reproductions of the original outlook.</p>

It is best visited during the summer months of March to June.</p>
