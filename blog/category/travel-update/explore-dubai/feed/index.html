Initially Dubai was a city of 700-800 members and was established as a fishing village and for pearl trading. Before the discovery of Oil in UAE, its economy revolved mainly around fishing and pearl industries. In 1962 after oil was discovered UAE&#8217;s society went through tremendous changes and Dubai played a major role in shaping its modern day Dubai. Present day Dubai earning from oil is less than one percentage. Major source of the Dubai Tourism economy is Tourism and real estate industries.
