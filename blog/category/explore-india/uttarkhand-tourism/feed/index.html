<p>Located in the heart of the mighty Himalayas, the holy town of Rishikesh is a paradox of sorts. While internationally revered as the &#8216;Yoga Capital of the World&#8217;, it&#8217;s also an adrenaline junkie&#8217;s paradise. And we&#8217;d be remiss if we didn&#8217;t let you in on this whitewater rafting secret!</p>

<p>Imagine being dwarfed by colossal, mist-laden peaks as the thunderous Ganga currents hurtle past you. Your heart&#8217;s pumping, every muscle is taut with anticipation as you await the rapids. This is level-next whitewater rafting, folks!</p>



<p>The Ganga&#8217;s frothing journey through Rishikesh is punctuated by stretches of relatively calm waters, interspersed with wild, untamed rapidsranging from grades 1 to 4+. From the gushing mouth of Shivpuri to hair-raising drops at Brahmpuri, it&#8217;s an obstacle course crafted by nature itself.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the kicker &#8211; we know these meandering veins like the back of our hand. With over a decade of experience, our rafting expeditions are a fine-tuned balance of safety and crazy thrills!</p>
