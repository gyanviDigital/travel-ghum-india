										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am born and brought up in Delhi but a girl for sure with Bihari influence. I am from&nbsp; India’s capital New Delhi, but my roots are in Bihar. And I’m quite aware of our culture and traditions like anyone else who lives in Bihar, maybe not more than them, but surely not less. And if we talk about the rich and vast Bihar’s history, be it Nalanda, Ashoka or Lord Buddha, Chankya, Rajgir tourism, Bodh Gaya, Gaya and Many more </p>

<p>From my childhood I saw my parents are inclined towards spirituality, they are fond of travelling all across and with them I got the opportunity to know more about our culture, history, and people. And what could be better than visiting Bihar with them several times. In this blog I’m going to share my experiences of twin spiritual cities of Gaya and Bodh Gaya. They are much more popular amongst foreign people than Indians. Bodh Gaya is a holy place for Buddhists and Gaya spiritual city attracts thousands of Hindu pilgrims, pilgrims come here for pind daan or offering prayers to ancestors. Plan your unforgettable <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/kashi-gaya-tour-package.php"><strong>Varanasi Gaya tour package</strong></a> with <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>Travel Agents in Delhi</strong></a>. <br>Holy city Bodh Gaya is the place where Gautam Buddha became Lord Buddha and attained enlightenment under a huge banyan tree, which is now known as the Bodhi Tree situated inside Maha Bodhi temple.&nbsp;Sarnath is the place where Lord Buddha gave his sermons to his followers or disciples. Explore holy city Sarnath on your <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/index.php/tour/domestic/VARANASI-TOURS"><strong>Varanasi tour packages</strong></a> from <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>Tour operators in Delhi</strong></a>. Gaya is also mentioned in great epics such as The Mahabharata, and The Ramayana. Here Lord Rama along with Sita mata and brother Lakshman visited Gaya for pind daan of their father Dasharath during the month of Pitru Paksha (also called Shradh).&nbsp;<br>Gaya and Bodh Gaya are two popular twin spiritual cities of India, both are famous for their rich religious culture and tradition. Gaya is famous for Hinduism and Bodh Gaya for Buddhism. We are here with suggestions for Things to do in Gaya and things to do in Bodh Gaya.&nbsp;<br>So, here are the few places, which we visited and according to me it’s worth visiting if you want to get an insight of sacred Indian destinations.</p>



<p><strong>Top 5 Places to visit in Gaya, Bihar</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="592" height="423" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vishnupad-temple.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-910" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vishnupad-temple.jpg 592w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vishnupad-temple-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Vishnupad Mandir (Temple)</strong><br>Vishnupad mandir is the main temple as well as major attraction of Gaya , the temple is situated on the banks of holy Falgu river and it features iconic 40-cm-long footprint of Lord Vishnu, which draws devotees from across the country and abroad. As per Natives of Gaya demon Gayasur was killed by Lord Vishnu here by stamping his foot on his chest. And after Lord Vishnu pushed Gayasur under the earth, his footprint was retained in a rock. This famous temple was built by Rani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, but it has been renovated several times in the past.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" width="680" height="510" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yama-Temple-–-Pretshila-Hill.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-911" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yama-Temple-–-Pretshila-Hill.jpg 680w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yama-Temple-–-Pretshila-Hill-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Yama Temple – Pretshila Hill</strong><br>Pretshila Hill, which really means hill of ghosts, kindly do not reckon it by its name, just kidding ;)… It is located on top of the hill in north-west of Gaya and holds a very special place for Hindus where they also do Pind Daan. This temple is dedicated to God Yama or Yamraj, who as per the&nbsp; Hindu mythology is the God of Death. Next to this temple there is a famous tank Known as Ramkund, As per locals lord Ram bathed once here and hence it got its name. Pilgrims believe that just by only taking a bath in this tank is going to wash away all their sins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="679" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mangla-Gauri-Temple-1024x679.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-912" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mangla-Gauri-Temple.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mangla-Gauri-Temple-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mangla-Gauri-Temple-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Mangla Gauri Temple</strong><br>Mangla Gauri Temple is one of the 18 Maha Shakti-peeth’s of Goddess Durga in India. It holds very high importance for the Hindus, and has been already mentioned in the 3 Puranas, Vayu, Padma, and Agni. The shrine over here is dedicated to Sati, the wife of Lord Shiva. The goddess here is worshipped in the breast-form, symbolizing the love of a mother. Devotees from all across India come here to pray so that all their wishes are fulfilled by the goddess. People have to climb more than 100 stairs to reach the temple.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Falgu-River.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-913" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Falgu-River.jpg 720w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Falgu-River-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Falgu River</strong><br>Whenever you plan to visit Gaya on your Gaya and BodhGaya tour package, don&#8217;t forget to give this unique river some place in your tour itinerary for Gaya. It is such a fascinating place where the entire river flows under the sand and not vice versa. There is a very interesting story that is related to that phenomenon. It is believed that during their exile (vanvas), Lord Rama and Sita decided to take rest for a while on the sandy banks. During the time frame for pind-daan, Rama went to make some arrangements of food to offer his ancestors, while Sita waited on the banks. During that period of time Lord Rama’s ancestors appeared in front of her and requested that the ceremony of offering food be conducted without delay. Rather than waiting for lord Rama, she performed the ceremony by offering sand, thereby granting them salvation.Later Sita thought that Lord Rama would not believe her, so she asked the sacrificial fire, a cow, the Falgu river, a brahman and a tree to stand witness for her act. Sadly, when Lord Rama arrived and questioned all the witnesses, they all turned false. They were hoping for a second round of offerings, therefore all the witnesses other than the tree said that Sita was lying. She was very enraged and cursed all the witnesses but the faithful tree. Thus, the Falgu river was condemned to run below the ground hiding his head in shame, for all time.<br>Apart from being a historical and religious city Gaya is famous for local foods specially local sweets like Tilkut ,&nbsp;longlata, Anarsa, Khubi ka Lai are famous sweets of Gaya, So when you are on Gaya tour packages do taste these sweets too. Best time to visit Gaya is from September to April every year.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Best Places to Visit in Bodhgaya , Tourist places in Bodhgaya :-&nbsp;<br>Dungeshwari Cave Temples<br>It is believed that as per locals that Lord Gautama Buddha meditated in the three caves here before continuing his journey to Bodhgaya. It is located around 12 km northeast of Gaya, also known as Mahakala Caves. This is the exact place where Lord Gautama realized that one cannot attain enlightenment by self-indulgence or self-abasement. And from here he reached Bodhgaya where he finally attained enlightenment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="715" height="480" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Mahabodhi-Temple.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-914" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Mahabodhi-Temple.jpg 715w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Mahabodhi-Temple-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /></figure>



<p><strong>The Mahabodhi Temple</strong><br>One of the most important and sacred religious sites for Buddhists in Bodh Gaya is the Mahabodhi Temple, the very place where Lord Buddha attained enlightenment. In 2002, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The major attraction of the Mahabodhi Temple is the famous huge Bodhi tree, beneath whose shade Gautam Buddha used to meditate. Even now, monks and devotees pray before the sacred Bodhi tree.&nbsp; As per records this temple was initially built by Great Emperor Ashoka after he started following Buddhism. There are few contradictions about that, but we shall not get into it. Overall, this place will offer peace to your mind and you can hear continuous canting. Visit Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya on your varanasi gaya tour package from a <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/"><strong>Travel Agency in Delhi</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Temple</strong><br>The Chinese Temple in Gaya stands near the Mahabodhi Temple and is a spectacular Buddhist temple built by Chinese-Buddhist monks. The architecture, therefore, is an amazing amalgamation of the beautiful Indian and Chinese architect designs, especially the temple exterior, which resembles a Chinese monastery. The Lord Buddha statue inside this Chinese Temple is believed&nbsp;to be more than 200 years old and&nbsp;has been made and imported from Mainland China. The temple has three beautiful and marvelous golden statues of Buddha.</p>

<p>Delhi girl for sure with Bihari influence. I grew up in India’s capital New Delhi, but my roots are in Bihar. And I’m aware of our culture like anyone else who lives in Bihar, maybe not more than them, but surely not less. And if we talk about Bihar’s history, it is vast, be it Nalanda, Ashoka or Lord Buddha. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mahabodhi-temple-complex-bodhgaya-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-862" srcset="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mahabodhi-temple-complex-bodhgaya-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mahabodhi-temple-complex-bodhgaya-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mahabodhi-temple-complex-bodhgaya-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mahabodhi-temple-complex-bodhgaya.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>My parents are inclined towards spirituality, they are fond of travelling as well and with them I got the opportunity to know about our culture, people, and history. And what could be better than exploring Bihar with them. In this blog I’m going to share our experiences of Gaya and Bodh Gaya. They are much more famous amongst foreigners than Indians. Bodh Gaya is a pilgrimage for Buddhists and Gaya attracts thousands of Hindu pilgrims, who come here for pind daan.

Gaya is mentioned in great epics such as The Mahabharata, and The Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama along with Sita and brother Lakshman visited Gaya for pind daan of their father Dasharath during the month of Pitru Paksha (also called Shradh).

<p><strong>Falgu River</strong><br>Whenever you plan to visit Gaya, make sure to give this unique river some place in your itinerary. It is such an interesting place where river flows under the sand and not vice versa. There is an interesting story is related with that phenomenon. It is believed that during their exile, Rama and Sita decided to rest for a while on the sandy banks. When it was time for pind-daan, Lord Rama went make some arrangements of food to offer his ancestors, while Sita waited on the banks. During that period Rama&#8217;s ancestors appeared in front of her and requested that the ceremony be conducted without delay. Rather than waiting for him, she performed the ceremony by offering sand, thereby granting them salvation.</p>

<p>Later she thought that Rama would not believe her, she asked the sacrificial fire, a cow, the Falgu, a brahman and a tree to stand witness for her act. Sadly, when Rama arrived and questioned the witnesses, they all turned false. They were hoping a second round of offerings, therefore all the witnesses other than the tree said that Sita was lying. She was enraged and cursed all the witnesses but the faithful tree. Thus, the Falgu was condemned to run below the ground hiding his head in shame, for all time.</p>
