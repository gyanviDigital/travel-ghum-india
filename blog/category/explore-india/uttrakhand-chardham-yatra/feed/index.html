<p>Shiva,&nbsp;the God who didn&#8217;t care what he wore, lived in solitude, and danced with abandon. Shiva who is also known as Mahadeva is one of the principal deities of Hinduism and&nbsp;I am a Shiva devotee. It’s a shrine dedicated to Shiva and located on the Garhwal Himalayan range in Uttarakhand. Pandemic in 2020 made it difficult to travel anywhere, but when I got this opportunity to pay my homage, I didn’t miss this chance. Along with Kedarnath we visited Badrinath, I mean when we are travelling that far then why not?!&nbsp;</p>

<p>We booked out trip through Ghum India Ghum which is a leading&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">travel agents in Delhi</a></strong>&nbsp;and that made our journey peaceful, now, you might be thinking that do I book all my tours through them (as I mention them frequently in my blogs), then the answer is YES! It’s smart to book your tours through travel agent/tour companies as occurrence of the natural calamities for places like these are high and they always have a contingency plan. Plus, you can always rely on them in case of any emergency, they are answerable for their services. I would suggest all of you to check the credential of your travel agent before booking trips or paying money. With internet everything is easy, and Google is our savior for sure. I’m associated with GIG which is a&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/">tour operator in Delhi</a></strong>&nbsp;for long and they have earned my trust.</p>

<p>Here in my blog on <a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/chardham-yatra-package.php">Uttarakhand Chardham Tours</a> along with best possible itinerary for Uttarakhand chardham yatra, I would try to cover as many topics as possible, since I had so many questions before booking my trip.</p>



<p><strong>Best time to visit Kedarnath and Badrinath</strong><br>Every year dhams opening dates are declared on Mahashivratri. Generally, summers from April to June and September to October are the&nbsp;best time to visit Kedarnath and Badrinath temple along with Yamunotri&nbsp;and Gangotri. These mentioned months are also the&nbsp;best time to visit Badrinath&nbsp;temple which is one of four dhams as per Hinduism.&nbsp;Kedarnath temple opening date and Badrinath temple opening dates always vary for few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to reach Kedarnath and Badrinath<br></strong>By flight:<br>If you want to reach Kedarnath by air, then the nearest airport is Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun. Almost all the major airlines have flights to this airport from all major Indian cities. Once you are in Dehradun, you can either take a bus or hire a cab to reach Kedarnath. Making advance booking as advisable <br><br>By road:<br>Kedarnath is well connected to the capital of India, New Delhi and Dehradun in Uttarakhand as well. Distance between New Delhi and Kedarnath is 295 km. You can hire a cab/bus from Delhi or Dehradun. It’s a lovely stretch, which you will enjoy in a road trip. Fare of bus and cabs will depend upon the size/seating capacity of the vehicle.<br><br>By train:<br>There is no railway station at Kedarnath. Nearest railway station is Rishikesh and it is well connected to almost all the major cities of India and has a regular train daily.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ghumindiaghum.com/blog/unexplored-places-to-visit-in-varanasi/">NOTE:- Unexplored places to visit in Varanasi</a></p>
